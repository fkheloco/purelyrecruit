### Differentiator 6: DBE/SBE Certification Value

---

## Section 2: Win Theme Development Process

### Step 1: Analyze RFP Priorities

**Activities:**
1. Review RFP evaluation criteria and scoring
2. Identify which criteria are weighted most heavily
3. Note mandatory vs. desirable qualifications
4. Identify any DBE/SBE or diversity requirements
5. Look for language indicating agency priorities (e.g., "community engagement," "innovation," "cost control")
6. Note any specific client stated priorities in RFP cover letter or instructions

**Output:** List of 5-7 key RFP priorities ranked by importance

**Example:**
- Primary emphasis: Community engagement and stakeholder management (40% of evaluation)
- Secondary emphasis: Team qualifications and experience (30%)
- Tertiary emphasis: Cost and schedule approach (20%)
- Mandatory: Federal compliance capability (10%)

---

### Step 2: Review Client History

**Activities:**
1. Research client website and prior project documentation
2. Review VSCE's prior interactions with this client (if any)
3. Identify client strategic priorities and current initiatives
4. Note client satisfaction with prior consultants (if known)
5. Identify key decision-makers and their stated priorities
6. Look for patterns in how client evaluates/selects vendors

**Output:** Client profile including priorities, culture, decision-making patterns, prior satisfaction

**Example:**
"CCTA emphasizes community involvement in transportation decisions. Their 2024 Strategic Plan highlights 'meaningful public engagement' 4 times. Prior consultant feedback suggests CCTA values responsiveness and direct access to senior staff."

---

### Step 3: Match VSCE Strengths to Client Priorities

**Activities:**
1. Map VSCE's six core differentiators to client priorities
2. Identify which differentiators are most relevant to this opportunity
3. Note relevant project experience that demonstrates each differentiator
4. Identify team members who embody each differentiator
5. Consider competitive context (what are competitors likely to claim?)
6. Identify unique VSCE advantages vs. expected competitors

**Output:** Strength-to-priority matrix showing alignment

**Example:**
- Client Priority: Community Engagement → VSCE Differentiator: Community-Centric Approach
  - Evidence: 15 prior community engagement projects, $500K invested in stakeholder programs
  - Team: Sarah Johnson, Community Outreach Director, 12 years experience

- Client Priority: Federal Compliance → VSCE Differentiator: Construction with Integrity
  - Evidence: 100% compliance on $50M federal projects, zero audit findings
  - Team: John Smith, PE, LACMTA-approved CM manager

---

### Step 4: Develop 3-5 Tailored Win Themes

**Activities:**
1. Draft 3-5 win themes directly addressing top client priorities
2. Frame themes from client perspective (not VSCE-centric)
3. Connect theme to VSCE differentiator and supporting evidence
4. Ensure themes are distinct (no redundancy)
5. Prioritize themes by relevance to client and competitive advantage
6. Draft 2-3 sentence explanation of each theme

**Guidelines:**
- Lead with client need/benefit, not VSCE capability
- Make themes specific to this client and opportunity (not generic)
- Ensure themes are defensible with evidence
- Themes should be distinctive from likely competitor themes

**Output:** 3-5 Win Themes with supporting narrative

"Successful bicycle infrastructure requires community support. VSCE brings proven community engagement experience from 15 prior bicycle and pedestrian projects, including the highly successful 2020-2021 Oakland Bike Master Plan implementation. Our approach combines monthly community meetings, transparent construction impact planning, and local hiring commitments, ensuring strong community support throughout the Adams Avenue project."

Our approach includes proactive compliance planning, documentation protocols, and regular federal agency coordination, ensuring the Adams Avenue project meets all FHWA and LAPM requirements without delays or cost overruns."

*Evidence:* LACMTA grade separation: $32M project, 100% compliance, delivered on schedule
*Differentiator:* Construction with Integrity
*Team Lead:* John Smith, PM, LACMTA-Approved

---

**Theme 3: Bicycle Infrastructure Specialization**
*Client Priority Addressed: Technical expertise in bicycle facility design and construction*

"Bicycle infrastructure requires specialized knowledge of design standards, user experience, and integration with existing transportation networks. VSCE has delivered construction management for 12 bicycle and pedestrian projects, including complex grade-separated facilities, protected lane conversions, and intersection improvements. Our team's deep understanding of bicycle design standards and construction coordination ensures high-quality, user-focused facilities that integrate seamlessly with Costa Mesa's transportation network."

*Evidence:* Oakland Bike Master Plan: 8 projects, 25 miles protected lanes, zero design/construction conflicts
*Differentiator:* Technical Excellence
*Team Lead:* Maria Garcia, Bicycle Infrastructure Specialist

---

**Theme 4: Local Presence & Partnership**

"Costa Mesa deserves a construction management partner that understands the community. VSCE has been based in Orange County for 8 years with strong relationships in Costa Mesa construction and professional community. Our team includes 40% Costa Mesa area residents, ensuring local knowledge and community commitment.

This agility is standard practice for VSCE."

*Evidence:* CCTA project: utilities conflict resolved in 2 weeks vs. expected 8 weeks
*Differentiator:* Agility & Responsiveness
*Team Lead:* John Smith, PM
