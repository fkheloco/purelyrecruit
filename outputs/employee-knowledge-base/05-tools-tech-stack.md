# 💻 Tools & Tech Stack

💡 **We're an AI-first company, and our tool stack reflects that.** Here's everything we use, organized by category, with access instructions for getting set up.

## Technology Philosophy

Our core principles for tools:
- **AI-first** — we integrate AI into everything, not as an afterthought
- **Best-in-class** — we pick the best tool for each job, not the cheapest
- **Security matters** — 2FA mandatory on everything, least-privilege access
- **Document everything** — if it's not in Notion or a shared system, it doesn't exist

## Communication & Collaboration

| Tool | What It's For | Access |
|---|---|---|
| **Google Workspace** | Email, Docs, Sheets, Drive, Meet | Set up on Day 1 |
| **Slack** | Daily communication, quick questions | Invite from your pod lead |

**Slack tips:**
- Use channels, not DMs (others benefit from conversations)
- Set your status when you're in deep work or away
- Use threads to keep conversations organized

## Project & Client Management

| Tool | What It's For | Access |
|---|---|---|
| **HubSpot** | CRM, client contacts, deal pipeline | Request from Farid |
| **Linear** | Project management, tasks, sprints | Invite from Usman |
| **Notion** | Knowledge base, docs, wikis, collaboration | Invite from workspace admin |

**HubSpot** is our single source of truth for all client and prospect data. If a contact or company exists, it should be in HubSpot.

**Linear** is where we track all project work. Every task, bug, and feature request lives here.

**Notion** is where we document everything — this knowledge base, operations guides, project notes, and more.
