▶ **Initial Message**:

```
Subject: AI that keeps your authentic touch

Hi Tanisha,

I came across TBA Consulting and really resonated with your approach — building authentic, relationship-driven marketing over 15+ years is something you just can't fake. And your work supporting women business owners in LA is truly inspiring.

I was wondering if you've thought about how AI tools could help you scale your content and campaign work without losing that personal touch? What we've been seeing is that boutique marketing firms are actually in the best position to use AI well — because you have the client relationships and brand understanding that make AI outputs genuinely good, not generic.

We help marketing consultancies build custom AI tools — things like brand voice models trained on each client's voice, automated content drafts that your team refines, and analytics dashboards that show campaign impact in real-time. Everything we create is 100% yours — no licensing, no shared IP.

I'd love to chat about what you're seeing in the market and whether there's a fit. Even if timing isn't right, I'm always excited to connect with entrepreneurs who are building something meaningful.

All the best,
Farid Kheloco
CEO / Co-Founder

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "AI feels inauthentic — my clients value the personal touch" | "I totally get that concern — and honestly, that's what makes your position so strong. Generic AI content IS bad. But custom AI trained on each client's specific brand voice and history? That's different. It's like having an assistant who's studied your client for years. Your team still refines everything — the AI just handles the first draft and data analysis so you can spend more time on strategy and relationships." |
| "I'm too small to invest in AI tools" | "Actually, that's exactly why AI is so powerful for boutique firms. The right tools can give you the output capacity of an agency five times your size — without the overhead. We typically start with one high-ROI tool, like automated content drafts or campaign analytics, and show measurable time savings in 60 days. The investment is a fraction of what a single hire would cost." |
| "My clients wouldn't want AI touching their marketing" | "That's a fair concern, and some clients do feel that way initially. What we've found is that when the deliverables are better and faster — and the client relationship stays just as personal — they don't care how the sausage is made. You're not selling 'AI marketing' to clients — you're delivering better results with the same personal attention. The AI is behind the scenes, making your team more productive." |
| "I don't understand AI well enough to use it" | "That's actually exactly what we're here for. We handle all the technical complexity — building, deploying, maintaining the tools. Your team just uses them, like any other software. And we train your team on exactly how to get the best results. Think of us as your fractional AI team — you don't need to become a technologist." |
