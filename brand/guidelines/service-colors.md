# Service-Specific Color System

## Overview

Each Purely Works service has a dedicated accent color for brand consistency across materials. When creating service-specific outputs (proposals, decks, one-pagers), use the service's accent color alongside our primary Metallic Gold and Chambray.

## Notes

**Consulting / Implementation:**
Consulting and Implementation are the same service area. Always use Fire Bush (#DC9645).

**Marketing:**
Marketing does not have a dedicated accent color yet. Default to:
- Use Chambray + Metallic Gold for general marketing materials
- Or select accent based on campaign tone

**Multi-Service Materials:**
When a proposal or deck spans multiple services:
- Use Metallic Gold + Chambray only (no service-specific colors)
- OR use Flex color (Fuzzy Wuzzy Brown) to indicate versatility
