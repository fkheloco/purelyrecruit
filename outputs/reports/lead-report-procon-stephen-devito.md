ProCon is already investing in robotics — AI is the natural next step. Strike while their innovation appetite is high.

**Angle**: Robotics innovation + AI as natural extension + federal project efficiency

▶ **Initial Message**:

```
Subject: AI analytics on top of your Spot robot data?

Hi Stephen,

I came across ProCon's work with Virginia Tech and the Boston Dynamics Spot robot for construction monitoring — genuinely impressive stuff. It's rare to see a construction management firm investing that boldly in emerging technology.

It got me thinking: the data that Spot and your project systems generate is incredibly valuable, but I imagine turning that raw data into actionable insights is still pretty manual. I was wondering if you've explored layering AI analytics on top of what you're already collecting?

We've been building custom AI tools for construction firms — things like predictive delay analysis, automated federal compliance reporting, and smart risk detection. Everything we build is 100% client-owned, no licensing.

I'd love to learn more about what ProCon is doing on the innovation front and explore whether there's a fit. Even if timing isn't right, I'm always excited to connect with someone pushing construction tech forward.

Happy to work around your schedule.

All the best,
Farid Kheloco

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have a technology team" | "That's great — and it shows in what you've built with the Spot robot program. What we typically do is complement internal teams, not replace them. Your tech team focuses on your core robotics and systems, while we build the AI analytics layer that makes all that data more actionable. Think of us as a specialized extension focused specifically on AI." |
| "Federal contracts have strict security requirements" | "Absolutely — and that's actually something we're very familiar with. Everything we build is 100% client-owned and deployed in your environment. We can work within FedRAMP, CMMC, and other compliance frameworks. We'd never ask you to send project data to a third-party cloud." |
| "We're still in early stages with our robotics program" | "That's actually the perfect time to think about the analytics layer. Building the AI pipeline alongside your robotics rollout means you can start getting actionable insights from day one, rather than collecting data for a year and then figuring out what to do with it. We can start small and scale as your program grows." |
| "Budget is allocated to the robotics program right now" | "I totally understand budget constraints, especially when you're investing in innovation. What if we started with a focused proof-of-concept — maybe automated project reporting or predictive schedule analysis — something that shows ROI in 60-90 days? That way, you can demonstrate value to leadership before committing to a larger engagement." |
