# LinkedIn Outreach Strategy — Purely Works

> **Owner:** Farid Kheloco, CEO
> **Date:** February 6, 2026
> **Contacts:** 4,589 LinkedIn connections | 116 Enriched Hot List | 15 Priority 1 | 43 SoCal Targets
> **Goal:** Convert LinkedIn connections into discovery calls using authentic, semi-automated outreach that doesn't feel like every other sales message on the platform.

## The Problem We're Solving

You have 4,589 LinkedIn connections. That's a goldmine sitting untouched.

Most founders fall into two traps: they either do nothing with their network (hoping people "come to them"), or they blast generic sales messages that get ignored alongside the other 500 InMails people receive.

We're going to do neither.

This strategy turns your existing network into a warm pipeline using **content-first visibility**, **value-driven re-engagement**, and **semi-automated workflows** — all in your voice, all feeling like genuine human connection.

## Your Contact Intelligence (What We're Working With)

### Priority Breakdown

| Tier | Count | % | Action |
|------|-------|---|--------|
| Priority 1 (80-100) | 15 | 0.3% | Immediate personal outreach |
| Priority 2 (60-79) | 1,170 | 25.5% | Content warming → warm outreach |
| Priority 3 (40-59) | 3,284 | 71.6% | Content visibility → passive nurture |
| Not a Fit | 120 | 2.6% | Skip (enterprise too large) |

### Enriched Hot List: 116 Contacts Deep-Researched

| ICP Vertical | Count | Service Fit |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| Talent Acquisition | 58 | Recruiting |
| Infrastructure Builders | 23 | Proposals / Development |
| Software Scale-Ups | 16 | Development / Consulting |
| Content Creators | 10 | Marketing / Content |
| Biotech Innovators | 7 | Marketing / Proposals |

### Key Data Points

* **97 of 116** enriched contacts are C-Suite / Owner level
* **31 contacts** are in SoCal (your backyard — coffee meeting territory)
* **Only 4** have email addresses on file (LinkedIn DM is our primary channel)
* **60 contacts** scored 70+ (top of Priority 2, nearly Priority 1)

## The Strategy: Three Layers of Outreach

Think of this like concentric circles. The inner ring gets the most personal attention. The outer ring gets automated visibility. Everyone gets something real.

### Layer 1: The Inner Circle (15 P1 + 10 Top SoCal P2)

**Who:** Your 15 Priority 1 contacts + the highest-scoring SoCal P2 contacts where you can realistically get a face-to-face coffee.

**Approach:** 100% personal. No automation. These are your highest-value prospects and they deserve real attention.

**Cadence:**

| Day | Action | Channel |
|-----|--------|---------|
| Day 1-3 | Engage with 2-3 of their recent LinkedIn posts (like + thoughtful comment) | LinkedIn |
| Day 4 | Send personal DM — value-first, no pitch | LinkedIn DM |
| Day 10 | Follow up with relevant article or insight | LinkedIn DM |
| Day 17 | Suggest coffee / call — specific, easy ask | LinkedIn DM |
| Day 30 | If no response: share their content with your network + tag them | LinkedIn Post |

**Why This Works:** By the time you DM them, they've already seen your name in their notifications 2-3 times. You're not a stranger — you're someone who's been paying attention to their work.

### Layer 2: The Warm Wave (60 High-P2 Contacts, Score 70+)

**Who:** The 60 contacts scoring 70-79 who are one trigger event away from Priority 1.

**Approach:** Semi-automated with personal touches. Use Expandi to handle the engagement sequences, but write messages in batches by ICP vertical so they feel tailored.

**Cadence:**

| Week | Action | Automation Level |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Week 1 | Auto-view profiles + auto-like recent post | Expandi (automated) |
| Week 2 | Send Vertical-Specific DM (see templates below) | Expandi (semi-auto, personalized template) |
| Week 3 | Share value content DM (article, insight, resource) | Expandi (semi-auto) |
| Week 4 | Soft ask — "would love to compare notes" | Manual follow-up for responders only |

**Key Rule:** Anyone who responds gets pulled into Layer 1 treatment immediately. No more automation — it's real conversation from there.

### Layer 3: The Visibility Engine (1,170 P2 + 3,284 P3 Contacts)

**Who:** Everyone else in your network who could plausibly become a prospect.

**Approach:** Content-first. You're not reaching out to 4,400 people individually — you're making sure they see you, know what you do, and think of you when the need arises.

**This is where LinkedIn content does the heavy lifting:**

* Post 3x/week with a rotating content mix (see Content Calendar below)
* Every post naturally reaches 5-15% of your network
* Over 4-6 weeks, most of your active connections will have seen you multiple times
* When they need AI services, recruiting help, or proposal support — you're top of mind

## Message Templates (In Your Voice)

> **Critical:** These are starting frameworks. Every message should be personalized with at least one specific detail about the person or their company. The personalization is what makes it not feel like spam.

### Template 1: Re-engaging an Old Connection (General)

```
Hi [Name],

It's been a while since we connected — I was looking through my network and your work at [Company] caught my eye. [Specific observation about their company or recent activity].

I've been building something interesting on my end — we're helping companies like [similar company in their ICP] use AI to [specific outcome relevant to their role]. Not the "AI replaces everyone" kind — more like giving teams superpowers to move faster.

Would love to catch up and hear what you're working on. No agenda — just genuinely curious.

All the best,
Farid
```

### Template 2: Talent Acquisition / HR Leaders

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed you're leading talent at [Company] — [specific observation, e.g., "looks like you're scaling the team based on the recent job postings I've seen"].

I was wondering if you've explored AI-assisted recruiting at all? We've been working with a staffing firm here in SoCal that cut their screening time by 40% without losing the human touch. Happy to share what we learned if it's useful.

Either way — would love to connect. I'm always curious how talent leaders are navigating this market.

All the best,
Farid
```

### Template 3: Construction / Infrastructure Leaders

```
Hi [Name],

Really interesting what [Company] has been doing with [specific project or news]. The infrastructure space is moving fast right now with all the IIJA funding hitting California.

We've been helping construction management firms streamline their RFP response process — one client went from 25 hours per proposal to about 8, which freed up their BD team to actually chase more work instead of being buried in paperwork.

I was wondering if that's a pain point you've seen too? Would love to compare notes.

All the best,
Farid
```

### Template 4: SaaS / Tech Leaders

```
Hi [Name],

I've been following [Company]'s growth — [specific observation about product, funding, or team]. Really cool to see.

Quick question — are you exploring adding AI features to your product? We've been embedding fractional AI engineering teams into SaaS companies, and one thing we keep hearing is how hard it is to hire for AI roles right now.

Not pitching anything — just genuinely curious how you're thinking about it. Happy to share some patterns we've seen work.

All the best,
Farid
```

### Template 5: SoCal — Coffee Meeting Ask

```
Hi [Name],

We're practically neighbors — I'm based in [your area] and saw you're in [their city]. I've been meaning to connect with more [their industry] leaders in the area.

I'd love to grab coffee sometime. No sales pitch — I'm just building relationships with people doing interesting work in SoCal. [Specific compliment about their work or company].

Happy to work around your schedule. What does a week from now look like?

All the best,
Farid
```

### Template 6: Value-First Follow-Up (For Non-Responders)

```
Hi [Name],

Wanted to share this — thought of you when I came across it.

[Link to relevant article, report, or insight specific to their industry]

[One sentence on why it's relevant to them specifically.]

Hope all is well on your end.

-Farid
```

### Template 7: The Warm Re-Engagement (For Connections Who Engaged With Your Content)

```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for engaging with my post about [topic] — your comment about [their specific comment or reaction] really stuck with me.

I'd love to continue that conversation. We've been doing a lot of work in [their space] and I think there's some interesting overlap.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call? I have a few ideas that might be useful for what you're building at [Company].

All the best,
Farid
```

## Content Calendar (The Visibility Engine)

Post 3x per week. Rotate across these categories:

### Weekly Posting Schedule

| Day | Content Type | Purpose |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| **Monday** | Industry Insight | Establish expertise in target verticals |
| **Wednesday** | Founder Story / Behind-the-Scenes | Build human connection and trust |
| **Friday** | Value Drop (tip, framework, or resource) | Give something useful, create engagement |

### Content Themes by Vertical

**For HR/Recruiting Audience:**
* How AI is changing talent acquisition (without replacing recruiters)
* The real cost of a bad hire vs. investing in better screening
* What we learned helping a staffing firm cut time-to-fill by 40%
* Why the best recruiters will be AI-augmented, not replaced

**For Construction/Infrastructure Audience:**
* The $62B California infrastructure opportunity nobody's talking about
* Why your best BD people are stuck writing proposals instead of winning work
* How one CM firm went from 45% to 50% win rate with AI-powered proposals
* The construction tech adoption gap (and what to do about it)

**For SaaS Audience:**
* Build vs. buy vs. fractional: the AI feature decision every CTO faces
* Why your next AI engineer might not be a full-time hire
* The hidden cost of NOT adding AI features to your product
* What growth-stage SaaS companies get wrong about outsourcing development

**Universal (Founder/CEO Content):**
* Lessons from building a company with AI at the core
* What "AI-augmented services" actually means (not what you think)
* The partnership model that changed how we work with clients
* Why we give clients 100% IP ownership (and why most companies don't)

## Recommended Tech Stack

### Core Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Cost | Priority |
|------|---------|------|----------|
| **HubSpot Starter** | CRM, contact tracking, deal pipeline | You have this | Keep |
| **Expandi** | LinkedIn automation (safe, cloud-based) | ~$99/mo | Get this |
| **Hublead** | Syncs LinkedIn activity → HubSpot | ~$30/mo | Get this |
| **Apollo.io** | Prospect research, email finding, data enrichment | Free tier or ~$49/mo | Get this |

### Why This Stack

* **Expandi** is the safest LinkedIn automation tool on the market. Cloud-based (no computer running 24/7), mimics human behavior patterns, and has built-in warmup sequences. It handles the repetitive stuff (profile views, auto-likes, message sequences) while you focus on the personal conversations.

* **Apollo.io** fills the research gap. You can look up any company's revenue, employee count, tech stack, and find direct email addresses. Use it to enrich your existing contacts and research companies before outreach.

* **Hublead** is the glue. Every LinkedIn interaction gets logged in HubSpot automatically. So when someone responds to your DM, you see the full history in your CRM without manual data entry.

### What NOT to Get

* **Dux-Soup** — 23% of users get LinkedIn warnings within 90 days. Too risky.
* **Lemlist** — Email-focused, not great for LinkedIn-primary strategy.
* **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** — Not needed yet. Your existing connections are the goldmine. Consider adding later when you've exhausted warm outreach.

## What Makes This Different From Every Other LinkedIn Strategy

1. **You're not selling — you're reconnecting.** These are people who already accepted your connection. The frame is always "catching up" not "pitching."

2. **Content does the pre-selling.** By the time you DM someone, they've seen your posts 3-5 times. You're familiar, not random.

3. **Vertical-specific messaging.** A recruiting leader gets a recruiting message. A construction exec gets an infrastructure message. Nobody gets a generic "I help businesses grow" pitch.

4. **The human stays in the loop.** Automation handles the repetitive visibility stuff (profile views, likes, scheduling). But every real conversation is you, being you.

5. **SoCal advantage.** 43 of your top contacts are local. Nothing beats "let me buy you a coffee" in a world of cold InMails.

6. **PACT methodology built in.** Every message is Problem-Aware (leading with their pain), Aligned (matching our service to their need), Collaborative (partnership language), and Trigger-Timed (outreach tied to real events).

*This is a living document. Update monthly based on what's working, what's not, and where the conversations are going.*
