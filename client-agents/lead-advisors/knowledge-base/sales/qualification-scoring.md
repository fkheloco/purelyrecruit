# LEAD Advisors Lead Qualification Scoring System

## 25-Point Scoring Framework

A systematic approach to lead qualification that helps identify prospects with highest likelihood of fit and success. Leads are scored across three primary dimensions: Firmographic Fit (10 points), Behavioral Signals (9 points), and Cultural Fit (6 points).

## Dimension 1: Firmographic Fit (10 Points Maximum)

**Action:** Immediate outreach, priority follow-up, assignment to senior sales
**Expected Close Timeline:** 3-6 months
**Success Probability:** High

**P1 Example:**
- Construction company, $50M revenue (5+5) + New CEO, 30% growth, leadership conference (3+3+2) + Values-driven, faith-based (6) = 24 Points

## Using the Scoring System

1. **Initial Qualification:** Score all new leads within 24 hours of identification
2. **Outreach Decisions:** Prioritize P1/P2 for immediate outreach; P3 for nurture
3. **Sales Time Allocation:** Spend primary time on P1/P2; periodic time on P3
4. **Follow-up Strategy:** Different cadences for different tiers (P1: weekly, P2: bi-weekly, P3: monthly)
5. **Deal Velocity:** P1 expected to close in 3-6 months; adjust for individual circumstances
6. **Re-scoring:** Update scores as new information emerges; some P3s may become P1 with growth

The 25-point system provides a objective, data-driven framework for lead qualification and resource allocation, helping focus sales efforts on prospects with highest likelihood of successful engagement.
