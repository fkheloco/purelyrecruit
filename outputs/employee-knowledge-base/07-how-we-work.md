# 📋 How We Work

💡 **Our processes exist to help you deliver great work consistently — not to slow you down.** Here's how we approach quality, delivery, and documentation.

---

## Our Delivery Philosophy

Three principles guide everything we deliver:
- **Quality over speed** — but AI helps us achieve both
- **Document as you go** — don't leave it for later
- **Communicate proactively** — share progress before anyone asks

---

## Project Lifecycle

Every project, regardless of service line, follows a similar arc:

### 1. Discovery & Scoping
- Understand the client's problem and desired outcome
- Define scope, timeline, and deliverables
- Set up project in Linear with clear milestones

### 2. Setup & Kickoff
- Provision tools and access
- Create project documentation in Notion
- Hold kickoff call with client and team

### 3. Execution & Delivery
- Work in sprints or defined phases
- Share progress updates regularly
- Use AI tools to accelerate where appropriate
- Get client feedback early and often

### 4. Review & Handoff
- Internal quality review before client delivery
- Client review and feedback incorporation
- Documentation and knowledge transfer
- Ensure client has everything they need to maintain/continue

## Quality Standards

### Before Delivering Anything to a Client
- [ ] Does it solve the client's actual problem?
- [ ] Has it been reviewed by at least one teammate?
- [ ] Is it free of errors, typos, and formatting issues?
- [ ] Does it follow our brand guidelines?
- [ ] Is the client set up to maintain it independently?
- [ ] Have we documented what was built and how it works?

### Service-Specific Standards

**Proposals:**
- All RFP requirements addressed point-by-point
- Proper formatting per RFP specs
- Client's past projects and qualifications highlighted
- Proofread by a second set of eyes

**Development:**
- Code is clean, commented, and follows project conventions
- All work done in client's repos/infrastructure
- Tests written for critical functionality
- Documentation includes setup instructions and architecture overview

**Recruiting:**
- Every candidate scored against defined criteria
- AI scoring validated by human recruiter
- Detailed candidate profiles with scoring rationale
- Cultural fit assessment included

---

## Documentation Standards

We document everything because:
- It reduces dependency on any single person
- It accelerates onboarding for new team members
- It helps clients maintain what we build
- It creates institutional knowledge that compounds

### Where Things Live

| Type of Documentation | Where It Goes |
|---|---|
| Company knowledge, processes, guides | **Notion** |
| Project tasks, bugs, features | **Linear** |
| Client contacts, deals, activities | **HubSpot** |
| Code and technical documentation | **GitHub** |
| Meeting notes and action items | **Notion** or **Google Docs** |
| Quick decisions and conversations | **Slack** (then document if important) |

### Documentation Best Practices
- **Write for your future self** — assume you'll forget the context in 3 months
- **Keep it scannable** — headers, bullets, tables over walls of text
- **Date everything** — add "Last updated: [date]" to important docs
- **Link don't duplicate** — reference existing docs instead of copying content
- **Review quarterly** — flag outdated content for updates

---

## Performance Expectations

We don't track hours — we track outcomes. That said, here's what consistent performance looks like:
- **Responsiveness:** Slack messages within a few hours, emails within 24 hours
- **Reliability:** Deliver what you committed to, by when you said you would
- **Quality:** Every deliverable meets our quality standards before it reaches a client
- **Communication:** Proactive updates, early flagging of blockers
- **Growth:** Actively learning and improving your skills

---

## Handling Blockers

When you're stuck:
1. **Try to solve it yourself first** — spend 15-30 minutes investigating
2. **Ask in your pod channel** — your teammates are your first resource
3. **Escalate to your pod lead** — if it's blocking progress
4. **Escalate to leadership** — if it involves a client relationship or business decision

📌 **Rule of thumb:** If you've been stuck for more than 30 minutes without progress, ask for help. Nobody will judge you for it.

## Feedback Loops

- **Pod check-ins:** Regular standups or async updates within your pod
- **Client check-ins:** Weekly or bi-weekly with clients (varies by engagement)
- **Monthly reviews:** Performance and growth conversations with leadership
- **Quarterly retros:** What's working, what's not, what should change
