# ❓ FAQs

💡 **Quick answers to the questions we hear most often.** If your question isn't here, ask in **#operations** on Slack.

## Getting Started

**Q: What should I do on my first day?**

Start with the **👋 Welcome to Purely Works** page in this Knowledge Base. It has a day-by-day guide for your first week.

**Q: How do I get access to tools?**

Your pod lead will set up your essential tools on Day 1 (Google Workspace, Slack, Bitwarden). For additional tools, post in **#operations** on Slack with what you need and why.

**Q: Is there a dress code?**

We're remote — wear whatever makes you comfortable. For client video calls, business casual is a good default.

## Day-to-Day Work

**Q: What are my working hours?**

We're flexible. Work when you're most productive, but be available during overlap hours for your pod. The US-Pakistan time zone overlap is particularly important for cross-team collaboration.

**Q: How do I know what to work on?**

Check your tasks in **Linear**. Your pod lead assigns priorities, but you're also expected to proactively pick up work when you see it.

**Q: What if I'm stuck on something?**

Try to solve it yourself for 15-30 minutes. Then ask in your pod's Slack channel. If it's still blocked, escalate to your pod lead. Nobody will judge you for asking for help.

**Q: Can I use AI tools for my work?**

Absolutely — we encourage it! Just make sure you review and refine AI output before it goes to a client. AI accelerates, but humans ensure quality.

## Communication

**Q: Should I use Slack or email?**

**Slack** for internal communication (always). **Email** for external/client communication.

**Q: When should I use a Slack channel vs. a DM?**

Default to channels. Others might benefit from the conversation. Use DMs only for truly personal or sensitive topics.

**Q: How quickly should I respond to messages?**

Slack: within a few hours during your working hours. Email: within 24 hours. If someone needs something urgent, they should say so explicitly.

**Q: Do I need to attend all meetings?**

Only the ones relevant to your work. If an agenda is shared beforehand and nothing applies to you, skip it. Meetings are optional unless explicitly required.

## Tools & Access

**Q: What password manager do we use?**

**Bitwarden.** It's mandatory. Use it for all work accounts. Never reuse passwords.

**Q: Is 2FA really mandatory?**

Yes. Every account. No exceptions. This protects our clients' data and our own.

**Q: What if I need a tool that's not on the standard list?**

Post in **#operations** with what you need, why, and an estimated monthly cost. Leadership reviews tool requests quickly.

## Clients & Delivery

**Q: Who talks to clients?**

Anyone can interact with clients when it's relevant to their work. For relationship management and business discussions, that's usually Farid or the pod lead.

**Q: What do I do if a client asks for something outside our scope?**

Don't say no immediately. Flag it to your pod lead or Farid. We often find creative ways to help — and scope expansions are good for business.

**Q: What if I notice a quality issue in someone else's work?**

Bring it up directly and kindly. We value catching issues before they reach clients. This isn't being critical — it's having each other's backs.

---

## Growth & Career

**Q: How are performance reviews done?**

Monthly 1:1s with leadership for ongoing feedback. Quarterly for more formal goal-setting and review. We focus on outcomes, growth, and alignment with our values.

**Q: How do I get promoted or take on more responsibility?**

Demonstrate consistent quality, ownership, and initiative. Talk to leadership about your goals. Growth opportunities are abundant in a company our size.

**Q: Can I switch pods or service areas?**

Yes — talk to leadership about your interests. Cross-pod experience makes you more valuable and keeps work interesting.

---

## Company & Culture

**Q: What makes Purely Works different from other agencies?**

Three things: AI-first delivery (not just human services), client IP ownership (everything we build belongs to them), and genuine partnership approach (we're an extension of their team).

**Q: Is Purely Works profitable?**

We're in growth mode, investing in scaling to $100K+ MRR. Revenue is growing steadily with strong client retention.

**Q: Will there be more hiring?**

Yes — we're scaling from 14 to 20 people through 2026. If you know great people, refer them!
