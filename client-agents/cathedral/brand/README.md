## Brand Communication Examples

### Positioning (For Advisors)
"Cathedral Center transforms your M&A and recruiting process by making assessment feel like valuable consulting rather than sales. Backed by 70 years of advisory expertise and evidence-based DNA scoring, Cathedral Center helps you evaluate partnerships with confidence."

### Positioning (For Investors/Partners)
"Cathedral Center is an AI-powered assessment platform for financial advisors. A 300,000+ advisor market has ~70% M&A partnership failure rate due to inadequate fit assessment. Cathedral Center solves this through evidence-based DNA assessment, addressing a major market gap with a subscription SaaS model."

### Value Proposition
"Cathedral Center transforms your recruiting and M&A process by making assessments feel like valuable consulting rather than sales."
