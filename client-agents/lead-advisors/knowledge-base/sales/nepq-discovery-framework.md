# NEPQ Discovery Framework

## Overview

The NEPQ discovery framework is a strategic, question-based approach to sales conversations developed by 7th Level and adopted by LEAD Advisors. Rather than launching into pitches or solutions, NEPQ guides salespeople through a sequence of question types designed to build understanding, uncover genuine needs, and establish a foundation for recommendations.

NEPQ stands for:
- **N**eed Awareness Questions (Situation Questions)
- **E**xplore Problems (Problem/Pain Awareness Questions)
- **P**ossible Consequences (Consequence/Impact Questions)
- **Q**uestion About Solutions (Solution/Change Awareness Questions)

Plus a fifth element for LEAD Advisors:
- **Four-Fires Cultural Fit Assessment**

The approach builds trust, demonstrates expertise, and leads prospects toward conclusions themselves—rather than being sold to.

## Phase 2: Problem Awareness Questions (5-6 Questions)

**Purpose:** Move beyond surface-level information to uncover pain points, challenges, and gaps in organizational leadership and culture. Help the prospect become aware of problems they may not have articulated.

## Phase 3: Consequence Questions (5-6 Questions)

**Purpose:** Help the prospect understand the cost, impact, and consequences of not addressing the problems they've identified. Move from "I have a challenge" to "This challenge is costly."

**Key Principle:** Don't tell them the consequences; ask questions that help them discover the consequences themselves.

   - Helps them see trajectory of unresolved problems

   - Shifts from problem cost to opportunity cost
   - Positive framing of "what could be"
   - Motivates investment mindset

**Tone & Approach:**

## Phase 4: Solution Awareness Questions (5-6 Questions)

**Purpose:** Assess openness to change, determine what they've tried before, understand what "success" looks like to them, and gauge readiness for investment in leadership development.

**Key Principle:** Not about pitching solutions, but understanding what they're open to and what success means in their context.

   - Begins positioning LEAD's systematic approach

5. **"If you could wave a magic wand and have your management team be exactly what you needed them to be—how would they show up differently? What capabilities, mindsets, or approaches would they have?"**
   - Paints vision of success
   - Identifies gaps between current and desired state
   - Makes desired future tangible

6. **"What would it take for you to know this was the right investment for your company?"**

**Tone & Approach:**

**Time Allocation:** 15-20 minutes

## Phase 5: Four-Fires Cultural Fit Assessment (5-6 Questions)

**Purpose:** Assess alignment with LEAD Advisors' Four-Fires Philosophy and values-driven approach. Determine if this is genuinely a good fit.

**Key Principle:** Show that you have values and approach that must align; you're not trying to work with everyone.

   - Aligns with Physical Fire emphasis

4. **"If we were to work together on leadership development, would it be important that the approach focus on developing the whole person—purpose, relationships, health, and professional capability? Or would you prefer a more narrow, skills-focused approach?"**
   - Directly asks about Four-Fires philosophy fit
   - Gives them choice in approach

## Key Principles Throughout

### Listen More Than You Talk

- Aim for 70% prospect talking, 30% you talking
- Your job is to understand, not convince
- Ask follow-up questions when they're not specific
- Take notes to show you're listening

### Ask, Don't Tell

- Instead of: "Many companies struggle with management transition"
- Ask: "How have your transitions from field to management typically gone?"
- Let them discover the problem, don't position it for them

### Build Trust Through Understanding

- Demonstrate genuine interest in their business
- Ask questions you genuinely want to know the answer to
- Don't have an agenda or script you're following
- Be willing to not work together if there's no fit

### Acknowledge Their Expertise

- They know their business better than you do
- Position yourself as here to help them think, not tell them what to do
- "That's really insightful..." when they make a good observation
- "You know your culture better than anyone..."

### Move Toward Conclusions Together

- By the end of the call, let them draw conclusions
- "Based on what we've talked about, does it seem like developing your management team is important?"
- "How are you feeling about whether this might be worth exploring further?"
- Let them suggest next steps when possible

### No Pressure Selling

- If they're not interested, genuinely let them go
- "It sounds like this might not be the right timing or fit—I appreciate your openness to the conversation"
- This actually builds credibility and sometimes brings them back
- Your willingness to walk away makes you trustworthy

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Jumping to Solutions
- Proposing Management Training before understanding their real needs
- Talking about Four-Fires before they see the value
- "Here's what I recommend..." too early

**Better:** Ask until you fully understand, then recommend

### Yes/No Questions
- "Do you have turnover challenges?" ← Invites yes/no
- "When you think about retention, what challenges come up?" ← Invites conversation

### Assuming Problems
- "I bet you have transition challenges..." (leading)
- "Most contractors struggle with this..." (positioning before asking)

**Better:** "How has that transition process gone when you've promoted internally?"

### Not Listening to the Answer
- Asking question but already thinking about next question
- Interrupting
- Looking at notes instead of at them

**Better:** Deep listening, follow-ups when needed, eye contact

### Positioning Too Early
- "We work with construction companies..."
- "Our approach is different because..."
- Talking about yourself before understanding them

**Better:** Ask 30 minutes before mentioning anything about LEAD

### Wrong Tone
- Salesy or pushy ("Let me show you what we can do")
- Condescending ("Most companies don't realize...")
- Too casual ("So your managers are probably a mess, right?")

**Better:** Curious, respectful, genuinely interested

## Following Up After Discovery

### If Strong Fit
- Summarize what you heard
- Share perspective on how LEAD can help
- "Here's what I'm thinking..."
- Propose next steps (typically a second call with Alan or Steve, or a proposal)

### If Uncertain Fit
- Be honest: "I want to make sure this is a good fit before we go further"
- Ask clarifying questions
- "Let me think about this and follow up with you..."

### If Not a Fit
- Be genuine: "I appreciate your openness, and I don't think this is the right fit"
- Offer value anyway: referral, resource, relationship
- Leave door open: "If things change, let's stay in touch"
- This builds long-term credibility

---

## Customizing for Different Triggers

### Conference/Event Follow-Up
- Situation: "How did you hear about LEAD at the conference? Did anything resonate?"
- Problem: "What's been on your radar since we met regarding leadership/culture?"
- Consequences: "If you don't address that, where will you be in a year?"
- Solution: "Are you open to exploring a more systematic approach?"

### Job Posting Angle
- Situation: "I saw you're hiring for a [leadership role]. What's driving that need?"
- Problem: "Are you seeing gaps in your current leadership that prompted the hire?"
- Consequences: "What will success look like for that role, and what's the cost of getting it wrong?"
- Solution: "Beyond hiring, have you considered developing your existing leaders too?"

### Leadership Transition
- Situation: "Congratulations on the new [CEO/CFO/etc.]. What's their mandate?"
- Problem: "What challenges is she inheriting? What needs to be different?"
- Consequences: "If she can't shift the culture/performance quickly, what happens?"
- Solution: "Would it make sense to have a structured approach to leading that change?"

### Four-Fires Alignment (Values-Driven Company)
- Situation: "I love your company's commitment to [values]. Tell me more about that."
- Problem: "Are your leaders fully aligned with those values in how they lead?"
- Consequences: "When there's misalignment between company values and leadership, what happens?"
- Solution: "Would a leadership approach that integrates those values be valuable?"

## Outcomes of Strong NEPQ Discovery

By the end of a well-executed NEPQ discovery conversation, you should have:

1. **Deep Understanding** – You genuinely understand their business, challenges, and desired future state
2. **Their Conclusions** – They've articulated the problem and its consequences themselves
3. **Trust** – You've demonstrated expertise, care, and genuine interest
4. **Mutual Assessment** – You both know if there's fit
5. **Clear Next Steps** – Everyone is clear on what happens next (or mutual agreement that now isn't the time)

The prospect should feel understood, respected, and like you genuinely want to help—whether you work together or not.
