## Go/No-Go Decision Framework

### Green Light (Pursue Aggressively)
- Firmographic fit is strong
- Cultural indicators are present
- Clear trigger/need exists
- Multiple stakeholders engaged
- Timeline reasonable

### Yellow Light (Proceed with Care)
- Some elements of fit missing
- Cultural alignment uncertain
- Single decision-maker only
- Timeline aggressive
- Budget unclear

### Red Light (Lower Priority or Pass)
