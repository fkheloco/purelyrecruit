# Purely Adventure — Monetization Strategy

## Revenue Model Overview

Purely Adventure uses a **freemium model** with multiple revenue streams. The priority for Year 1 is traffic generation with tasteful, non-intrusive monetization.

## Revenue Streams

### 1. Display Advertising (Primary — Free Tier)

* **Approach:** Tasteful display ads that don't disrupt the reading experience
* **Platforms:** Google AdSense initially, migrating to premium ad networks as traffic grows (Mediavine at 50K sessions/month, AdThrive at 100K)
* **Placement:** Sidebar, between content sections, footer — never intrusive pop-ups or interstitials
* **Revenue Model:** CPM (cost per thousand impressions) and CPC (cost per click)
* **Traffic Targets:**
  * Month 6: 10,000 monthly sessions
  * Month 12: 50,000 monthly sessions
  * Month 18: 100,000+ monthly sessions

### 2. Affiliate Links (Primary — Free Tier)

* **Approach:** Natural affiliate link placement within gear reviews, product spotlights, and destination guides
* **Priority Programs:**
  * Amazon Associates (broad gear coverage)
  * REI Affiliate Program (outdoor gear)
  * West Marine (boating gear and supplies)
  * Booking.com / Expedia affiliates (travel bookings)
  * Specific gear brand programs (Yeti, ARB, Garmin, etc.)
  * Tour operator affiliate programs
* **Content Types for Affiliates:**
  * Gear reviews and comparisons
  * "Best of" lists (best overlanding gear, best sailing accessories)
  * Product spotlights in daily digests
  * Trip planning guides with booking links
* **Disclosure:** Always transparent — clearly marked affiliate links

### 3. Sponsor Messages (Secondary)

* **Approach:** Dedicated "Message from Our Sponsor" section in daily digests
* **Format:** Short, clearly labeled sponsor placement within email and on-site digests
* **Target Sponsors:** Overlanding gear companies, boat manufacturers, adventure travel companies, outdoor brands
* **Pricing:** Flat rate per placement or CPM-based, scaled with audience size

### 4. Premium Tier (Future — Year 2+)

* **Concept:** "Support us and shut down the noise" — pay to remove ads
* **Features:**
  * Ad-free reading experience
  * Potentially: early access to content, exclusive guides, community features
* **Pricing:** TBD — likely $5-10/month or $50-80/year
* **Launch Timing:** After establishing consistent traffic and proving the free tier value

## Monetization Principles

* **Tasteful first** — Ads should never ruin the reading experience
* **Honest always** — Affiliate recommendations must be genuine; never recommend something just for the commission
* **Transparent** — Clearly label sponsored content and affiliate links
* **User-first** — Revenue supports the platform, but user experience comes first
* **No clickbait** — Traffic generation through quality content, not misleading headlines

## Revenue Timeline

**Months 1-3:** Focus entirely on content and traffic. Minimal monetization (basic AdSense, Amazon Associates setup).

**Months 4-6:** Scale affiliate content (gear reviews, product roundups). Optimize ad placement. Begin sponsor outreach.

**Months 7-12:** Hit traffic milestones for premium ad networks. Active affiliate program across all categories. Regular sponsor placements. Revenue target: covering operational costs.

**Year 2:** Launch premium tier. Expand sponsorships. Explore direct brand partnerships. Revenue target: sustainable income.

## Key Metrics to Track

* Monthly sessions and pageviews
* Ad revenue (CPM, total)
* Affiliate click-through rate and conversion rate
* Revenue per visitor (RPV)
* Email subscriber count (newsletter = direct monetization channel)
* Premium tier subscribers (when launched)
