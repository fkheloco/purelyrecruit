# LEAD Advisors Sales Process

## Sales Process Overview

The LEAD Advisors sales process is a systematic, relationship-driven approach to identifying prospects, assessing fit, discovering needs, and closing engagements. The process emphasizes genuine partnership and ensuring mutual fit rather than transactional selling.

The process consists of six primary stages:
1. Lead Identification (Opportunity Sourcing)
2. Lead Scoring (Qualification)
3. Outreach (Initial Contact)
4. Discovery Call (Needs Assessment)
5. Program Recommendation (Solution Design)
6. Proposal & Close (Commitment)

## Stage 1: Lead Identification & Opportunity Workflows

Lead identification uses multiple opportunity workflows and channels to identify prospects that match the ideal customer profile.

### The Seven Opportunity Workflows

LEAD Advisors identifies leads through seven distinct workflows or trigger events:

#### Workflow 1: Conference & Industry Event Attendance

**Signal:** Prospect attends industry conference, trade show, or company event

**Identification Method:**
- LEAD Advisors personnel attend construction/industry conferences
- Collect business cards or LinkedIn connections at booth
- Build relationship during event
- Note key conversation topics and interests

**Companies/Events:**
- AGC (Associated General Contractors) meetings
- Industry-specific conferences (construction, professional services)
- Regional economic development events
- Trade associations and networking events

**Outreach Timing:** Within 24-48 hours of event
**Template:** Build Expo / Conference Follow-Up

**Key Questions Asked:**
- "What brought you to the conference?"
- "What topics or sessions resonated with you?"
- "What challenges are you working on right now?"

**Example:**
- Attend AGC regional conference → Meet project manager from $50M GC → Connect on LinkedIn → Email within 48 hours referencing specific conversation

**Outreach Timing:** Within 1-2 weeks of posting publication
**Template:** Job Posting Angle

**Connection Point:**

**Timing:** Score all new leads within 24 hours of identification

**Assignment:**

## Stage 3: Outreach & Initial Contact

**Outreach Templates by Trigger:**

- Job Posting Angle
- Leadership Change Angle

For detailed templates, see [sales/outreach-templates.md](../sales/outreach-templates.md)

**Outreach Sequence:**
1. **Day 1-2:** Initial outreach (email + LinkedIn if available)
2. **Day 7:** First follow-up if no response (gentle)

**Success Metrics:**

## Stage 4: Discovery Call & Needs Assessment

## Sales Handoff to Delivery

Once deal is won:
1. Send signed agreement and contract file to Martha or delivery team
2. Schedule kickoff call with prospect
3. Introduce delivery team to client
4. Share discovery notes and client context with delivery team
5. Ensure smooth transition and early program success
6. Sales maintains relationship but delivery takes primary role

The best sales process results in successful client engagements that deliver on promises and build long-term partnerships.
