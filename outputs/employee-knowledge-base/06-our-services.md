# 🎯 Our Services — The Big Five

💡 **We deliver five core services, each powered by AI and refined by humans.** Whether you're on the Proposals pod or the Dev team, understanding all five helps you see the bigger picture.

---

## Why Everyone Should Know All Five

Even if you only work in one service area, understanding the full picture matters:
- Clients often start with one service and expand to others
- Cross-pod referrals are one of our best growth drivers
- You'll communicate better with teammates when you understand their work
- It helps you spot opportunities to add value in client conversations

## 🔵 Proposals

**What we do:** AI-powered RFP and SOQ response, primarily for construction management firms.

**How it works:** Our AI systems draft initial proposal content using the client's past projects, team qualifications, and our knowledge base. Human writers then refine, customize, and ensure compliance with RFP requirements.

**Typical engagement:**
- $7,000-$13,000/month depending on volume
- 1.5 to 4+ concurrent proposals
- End-to-end from RFP release to submission

**Who benefits:** Construction management firms that respond to government RFPs and need to win more work without burning out their staff.

**Key metric:** Proposals that used to take 25+ hours can be delivered in under 8 hours.

---

## 🟣 Development

**What we do:** Custom software and AI development delivered by fractional engineering teams.

**How it works:** Clients get dedicated developers (0.5 to 2.5 FTE equivalent) working on their projects, in their GitHub, on their infrastructure. All code is 100% client-owned from day one.

**Typical engagement:**
- $3,000-$12,000/month depending on team size
- 3-6 month projects are common
- Full stack, data/AI, systems, integrations

**Who benefits:** Companies that need engineering talent but can't afford (or don't want) full-time hires. Especially SaaS companies adding AI features.

**What we build:** AI chatbots, recommendation engines, CRM integrations, custom dashboards, voice agents, workflow automation — anything where AI creates compounding value.

---

## 🟠 Consulting & Implementation

**What we do:** AI strategy, business advisory, and hands-on implementation.

**How it works:** We assess where AI can create the most value for a client, design the strategy, and then implement it. This ranges from monthly strategy sessions to full transformation projects.

**Typical engagement:**
- $3,000-$6,000/month for advisory
- Project-based for implementation
- Monthly check-ins with strategic guidance

**Who benefits:** Mid-market companies that know they need AI but don't know where to start. Companies in transition (growth, M&A, succession).

---

## 🟢 Recruiting

**What we do:** AI-enhanced talent acquisition — finding, scoring, and presenting qualified candidates.

**How it works:** Our AI models score candidates against client requirements and culture fit. Human recruiters validate every candidate before presentation. We work within the client's existing ATS/CRM.

**Typical engagement:**
- $3,000-$6,000/month
- 2-6 concurrent positions
- Multi-platform sourcing (LinkedIn, Indeed, specialty boards)

**Who benefits:** Staffing firms, construction companies, and any growing business that needs to hire quality talent faster.

**Key metric:** 40% reduction in time-to-screen, 50% faster interview scheduling.

---

## 🔴 Marketing

**What we do:** AI-enabled content creation, campaign strategy, and marketing support.

**How it works:** We use AI tools to generate content drafts, analyze performance data, and optimize campaigns. Human marketers ensure brand consistency and strategic alignment.

**Typical engagement:**
- Varies by scope — content packages, campaign management, social media
- Often bundled with other services through Purely Flex

**Who benefits:** Companies that need marketing muscle but don't have an in-house team, or teams that need AI tools to multiply their output.

---

## The Purely Flex Model

Many clients start with **Purely Flex ($6,000-$8,400/month)** — a flexible package that gives them access to multiple service lines. Bandwidth shifts based on monthly priorities.

**Why Flex works:**
- Clients don't have to commit to one service
- Resources shift as needs change
- It's the best starting point for new clients
- Lower commitment, faster time-to-value
