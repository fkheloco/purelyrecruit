## Brand Voice

### Personality: Practical, Trustworthy, Rugged, Authentic

Write like you're talking to a friend at camp — someone who's done the trip, used the gear, and tells the truth about it.

### Voice Rules
* **Direct** — Get to the point. No fluff or filler.
* **Knowledgeable** — You know your stuff. Share it clearly.
* **Encouraging** — Everyone starts somewhere. Zero judgment.
* **Conversational** — Not corporate. Not academic. Real talk.
* **Honest** — If something isn't great, say so. Never fake enthusiasm.

### Tone by Context
* Daily Digests: Informative, efficient, lightly conversational
* Gear Reviews: Detailed, honest, matter-of-fact
* Destination Guides: Inspiring but practical
* Beginner Content: Warm, encouraging, accessible
* Community Interaction: Supportive, positive, welcoming

### What to Avoid
* Clickbait headlines or sensationalist language
* Excessive exclamation points or emojis
* Corporate jargon or overly formal phrasing
* Gatekeeping language ("every real overlander knows...")
* Fake enthusiasm for sponsored products
* Polished Instagram-style perfection — keep it real

### Writing Examples

**Headlines:**
* Good: "5 Recovery Boards That Actually Work (And 2 to Skip)"
* Bad: "YOU WON'T BELIEVE These Amazing Recovery Boards!!"

**Reviews:**
* Good: "The ARB awning held up through three days of desert wind. No complaints."
* Bad: "This is absolutely the BEST awning on the market!! 🔥"

**Beginner Content:**
* Good: "New to overlanding? Start with recovery boards before a rooftop tent."
* Bad: "Every serious overlander knows the essentials."

## Content Standards

### Quality
* All facts, specs, and claims must be verifiable
* Every piece should deliver practical value
* Never recommend products solely for affiliate commissions
* Clearly label sponsored content and affiliate links
* Flag content as family-friendly or general audience

### Affiliate Links
* Always disclose: "This article contains affiliate links"
* Only recommend products you would genuinely endorse
* Include non-affiliate alternatives when relevant
* Natural placement — never forced or intrusive

### Sponsored Content
* Clearly marked: "Sponsored by [Brand]" or "Message from Our Sponsor"
* Visually separated from editorial content
* Sponsors don't buy opinions — honest always
