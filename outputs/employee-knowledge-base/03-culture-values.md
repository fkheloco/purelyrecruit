# 🔥 Our Culture & Values

💡 **Culture isn't a poster on the wall — it's how we actually treat each other and our clients every day.** These are the 5 values that drive everything at Purely Works.

## Our 5 Core Values

### 1. Client Partnership Over Vendor Relationship

We don't think of ourselves as vendors. We're an extension of our client's team.

**In practice:**
- We use "we" and "our" language — never "us vs. them"
- We proactively flag risks and opportunities, even when not asked
- We celebrate client wins as our wins
- We're transparent about challenges — no hiding behind status reports

### 2. Excellence Through AI Enhancement

AI is our accelerator, not our replacement. We use it to do better work, faster.

**In practice:**
- Every team member is expected to explore and use AI tools
- We build AI into our delivery processes from day one
- We share AI discoveries and techniques across pods
- Quality always trumps speed — AI helps us achieve both

### 3. Transparent & Proactive Communication

Don't wait to be asked. Over-communicate early, under-promise and over-deliver.

**In practice:**
- Share progress updates before anyone asks for them
- Flag blockers immediately — don't sit on problems
- Document decisions so others can understand the "why"
- Default to Slack channels (not DMs) so the team benefits

### 4. Continuous Growth & Learning

We're all getting better, every week. Stagnation is the only failure.

**In practice:**
- Dedicate time to learning new tools and techniques
- Share what you learn with the team
- Give and receive feedback openly
- Treat mistakes as learning opportunities, not failures

### 5. Ownership Mindset

If you see it, you own it. Don't wait for someone to assign it.

**In practice:**
- If something's broken, fix it or flag it — don't walk past it
- Take responsibility for outcomes, not just tasks
- Follow through on commitments without reminders
- Think like a founder — your work directly impacts our success

## How We Communicate

We're **async-first and remote-global.** Here's how that works:

### Communication Channels

| Channel | Use For | Response Time |
|---|---|---|
| **Slack** | Daily communication, quick questions, updates | Within a few hours |
| **Email** | External communications, formal correspondence | Within 24 hours |
| **Notion** | Documentation, long-form content, knowledge base | As needed |
| **Linear** | Project tasks, bug reports, feature requests | Check daily |
| **Google Meet** | Meetings, pair-working, client calls | Scheduled |

### Communication Norms

- **Async by default.** Write clear messages that don't require real-time back-and-forth.
- **Respect deep work time.** Don't expect instant replies unless it's truly urgent.
- **Use channels, not DMs.** Others might benefit from the conversation.
- **Be specific in requests.** "Can you review this by Thursday?" beats "Can you take a look?"
- **Document decisions.** If it's not written down, it didn't happen.

## Meeting Culture

We keep meetings **short, focused, and optional when possible.**
- All meetings have an agenda shared beforehand
- Meetings start on time and end on time
- If it can be a Slack message or Notion doc, it should be
- Camera-on is encouraged but not required
- Meeting notes are shared afterward for anyone who couldn't attend

---

## Remote-First Operating Model

We're a distributed team — US leadership in Southern California, operations team in Pakistan. This means:
- **Overlap hours matter.** Be mindful of time zones when scheduling.
- **Written communication is king.** Assume your teammate might read your message 8 hours later.
- **Trust is the default.** We hire great people and trust them to deliver.
- **Results over hours.** We care about what you produce, not when you're online.

---

## Work-Life Balance

- **Flexible hours** — work when you're most productive
- **No burnout culture** — sustainable pace wins long-term
- **Take breaks** — stepping away often leads to better work
- **Life happens** — communicate early if you need flexibility, and you'll get it

## Cultural Anti-Patterns

These behaviors don't fit how we work:
- ❌ Waiting to be told what to do
- ❌ Hiding mistakes instead of owning them
- ❌ Working in silos without sharing context
- ❌ Treating AI as a threat instead of a tool
- ❌ Optimizing for looking busy instead of being effective
- ❌ Treating feedback as criticism instead of a gift
