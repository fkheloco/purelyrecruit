## Outreach Strategy

> ⏰ **Timing**: ⚡ **Immediate**
Enterris is expanding rapidly — Nikhil needs operational tools to scale advisory services across multiple offices.

**Angle**: Legal/advisory process complexity + multi-office scaling + AI efficiency

▶ **Initial Message**:

```
Subject: AI for advisory services at Enterris?

Hi Nikhil,

I came across Enterris Associates and was impressed by the growth you and Samir have built — especially the advisory services practice spanning San Diego, Pasadena, and Santa Ana.

With your background in construction law and public works, I imagine managing pre-development agreements, inter-agency coordination, and stakeholder engagement across multiple offices involves a tremendous amount of complex documentation and compliance tracking.

I was wondering if you've explored AI-powered tools to help streamline some of that — things like automated contract analysis, compliance monitoring across jurisdictions, and smart document management? We've been helping infrastructure consulting firms build custom tools that handle the heavy lifting so their teams can focus on the advisory work that actually requires expert judgment.

Everything we build is 100% client-owned — no licensing, no shared IP. Happy to share some examples if you're curious.

All the best,
Farid Kheloco
CEO / Co-Founder

- **Day 14**: Reference multi-office coordination challenges, offer quick assessment call

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already work with Samir on technology decisions" | "That makes total sense — and I'd love to include Samir in the conversation. What I've found is that the advisory services side has unique needs around legal compliance and stakeholder management that benefit from a focused approach. Would it make sense to set up a quick call with both of you to explore where AI could add the most value across all divisions?" |
| "Legal processes require human judgment" | "Absolutely — and that's exactly our philosophy. We call it 'AI-First, Human-Finished.' The AI handles the heavy lifting — document search, compliance tracking, risk flagging — but your team's legal judgment stays central to every decision. Think of it as having a paralegal that never sleeps and processes documents in seconds instead of hours." |
| "We're focused on growth right now, not internal tools" | "I totally get that — and growth is exactly why this matters now. The challenge most firms face when scaling across multiple offices is that manual processes that worked at one location break down at three. Building the right operational tools now means you can grow to 5 or 10 offices without proportional administrative overhead." |
| "How does this work with attorney-client privilege?" | "Great question — and it's one we take seriously. Everything we build is deployed in your environment, client-owned, and never touches third-party servers unless you choose that. Your data stays yours, with the same confidentiality protections you'd apply to any internal system. We can structure the engagement to comply with your professional obligations." |
