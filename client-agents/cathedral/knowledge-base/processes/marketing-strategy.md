# Cathedral Center Marketing Strategy

## Marketing Overview

Cathedral Center's marketing strategy focuses on thought leadership, content-driven engagement, and relationship building with financial advisors. The approach emphasizes "consulting not sales" by positioning Cathedral Center as a valuable advisory resource rather than a transactional tool.

**Core Marketing Principle:** Add value first, build trust, then convert to paid offerings
