# Purely Works Ideal Customer Profiles — Strategic Guide

> **Purpose:** Strategic framework for targeting the five market segments where Purely Works has competitive advantage. This guide provides the path to $100K MRR by September 2026.

---

## Market Position

Purely Works sits at the intersection of AI expertise and service delivery — addressing a critical market gap. Mid-market companies need AI capabilities but can't afford Big 4 consulting ($300K+ projects) or navigate complex SaaS tools alone. Validated client relationships with VSCE Inc (construction) and Brio Solutions (recruiting) prove two immediately scalable ICPs.

## The Five ICPs

| Rank | ICP | Priority | Target Clients | Avg Retainer | Key Advantage |
|------|-----|----------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | Infrastructure Builders (Construction) | ★★★★★ | 6-8 @ $12K | $12K/mo | Proven fit, validated pricing, IIJA timing |
| 2 | Talent Acquisition (Staffing) | ★★★★★ | 10-12 @ $8K | $8K/mo | Proven fit, urgent pain, fast sales |
| 3 | Software Scale-Ups (SaaS) | ★★★★☆ | 5-7 @ $15K | $15K/mo | High revenue potential, strong SoCal ecosystem |
| 4 | Content Creators (Entertainment) | ★★★★☆ | 6-8 @ $12K | $12K/mo | Massive local market, service alignment |
| 5 | Biotech Innovators (Life Sciences) | ★★★☆☆ | 4-6 @ $18K | $18K/mo | Highest revenue potential, longest sales cycle |

## Recommended Portfolio Mix to $100K MRR

**Primary Strategy:**
* **4 Construction clients** @ $12K/month = $48K MRR
* **4 Staffing clients** @ $8K/month = $32K MRR
* **2 SaaS clients** @ $15K/month = $30K MRR
* **Total: 10 clients = $110K MRR**

**Strategic Approach:**
* Focus 80% effort on Construction + Staffing (proven segments)
* Add Entertainment or SaaS for diversification
* Target 12 clients across top 3 ICPs for buffer

## Competitive Positioning Summary

### "Client Owns All IP" (HIGH VALUE)

* **Make this the lead differentiator in all sales materials**

### "AI-First, Done-for-You" (HIGH VALUE)
* SaaS tools (Loopio, HireVue, Jasper) require client expertise
* Big 4 consulting is strategy-only at 5-10x the price
* Purely Works delivers capability + execution at mid-market pricing

### "Fractional Teams" (MEDIUM-HIGH VALUE)
* Market trend toward flexible engagement models
* 40-60% cost savings vs. full-time equivalents
* Particularly resonant with funded startups managing burn rate

* Local presence matters for relationship-driven industries
* Time-zone alignment for all West Coast clients
