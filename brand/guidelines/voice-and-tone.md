## Key Messaging Pillars

**Always Emphasize:**
- AI as accelerator, humans as finishers (never "AI replaces people")
- Partnership over vendor relationship
- Client ownership and transparency (they own all IP)
- Flexible, scalable engagement models
- Remote-global capability as an advantage
- Results over process — outcomes, not hours

**Never Say:**
- "We're the cheapest option"
- "We replace your team"
- "AI does everything"
- "One-size-fits-all"
- Corporate jargon without explanation
