## Objection Handling Playbook

| Objection | Response Strategy | Sample Comeback |

| "We don't have budget right now" | Explore ROI — often about prioritization | "I get it. If this could save you [specific value], would it be worth a 15-min conversation about approach?" |
| "We already work with [competitor]" | Differentiate on outcomes, ownership, partnership | "I respect that. What we do differently is [specific differentiation]. Curious if [business outcome] is a priority?" |
| "Send me information" | Avoid one-way info dump — pivot to conversation | "Happy to — but first, what would be most relevant to you? Let's find 15 mins to talk specifics." |
| "Let me talk to [other stakeholder]" | Support the internal champion | "Perfect. Here's what I'd suggest sharing with them: [specific talking points]." |
