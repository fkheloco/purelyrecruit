# Purely Adventure — Brand Guidelines

## Brand Personality

Purely Adventure is **practical, trustworthy, rugged, and authentic**.

We're the friend who's actually done the trip, used the gear, and will tell you the truth about it. No sponsored fluff, no influencer polish — just real adventure content you can trust.

### Personality Traits

* **Practical** — Every piece of content has actionable value
* **Trustworthy** — Honest reviews, verified information, transparent sponsorships
* **Rugged** — Real adventures, real stories, dirt and all
* **Authentic** — We say what we mean and recommend what we'd actually use
* **Inclusive** — Adventure is for everyone, not just the extreme or the wealthy

### What We're NOT

* Polished Instagram perfection
* Clickbait or sensationalist
* Gatekeeping or elitist
* Corporate or overly professional
* Toxic or argumentative

## Brand Voice & Tone

### Voice (Consistent)

* **Direct** — Get to the point. No fluff.
* **Knowledgeable** — We know our stuff and share it clearly
* **Encouraging** — We want you to get out there, wherever your level
* **Conversational** — Write like you're talking to a friend at camp
* **Honest** — If something isn't great, we'll say so

### Tone (Varies by Context)

* **Daily Digests:** Informative, efficient, lightly conversational
* **Gear Reviews:** Detailed, honest, matter-of-fact
* **Destination Guides:** Inspiring but practical — "here's why, here's how"
* **Beginner Content:** Warm, encouraging, zero judgment
* **Community Interaction:** Supportive, positive, welcoming

### Writing Examples

**Good:** "The ARB awning held up through three days of desert wind. No complaints."
**Bad:** "OMG you NEED this awning!! It's absolutely AMAZING!! 🔥🔥🔥"

**Good:** "If you're new to overlanding, start with a solid set of recovery boards before you invest in a rooftop tent."
**Bad:** "Every serious overlander knows you need recovery boards."

**Good:** "This route isn't family-friendly — steep switchbacks and no guardrails. Save it for experienced drivers."
**Bad:** "This route is insanely dangerous!! Don't even try it!!"

## Visual Identity

### Direction: Bold & Energetic

The visual identity should feel **bold, energetic, and adventurous** — not muted or corporate. Think high-contrast colors, strong typography, and imagery that makes you want to pack your bags.

### Color Palette (Recommended Starting Point)

* **Primary:** Deep Orange (#E86C2C) — Energy, adventure, warmth
* **Secondary:** Charcoal (#2D2D2D) — Grounding, strength, readability
* **Accent:** Teal (#1A8C8C) — Sea/water connection, freshness
* **Light Neutral:** Off-White (#F5F2ED) — Clean backgrounds, breathing room
* **Dark Neutral:** Near-Black (#1A1A1A) — Text, contrast
* **Alert/CTA:** Bright Yellow (#F5C518) — Attention, energy, action buttons

*Note: These are recommendations. Final colors should be refined during logo/brand design phase.*

### Typography Direction

* **Headlines:** Bold, condensed sans-serif — strong and adventurous (e.g., Oswald, Barlow Condensed, Bebas Neue)
* **Body Text:** Clean, readable sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Source Sans Pro, Open Sans)
* **Accent/Quotes:** Optional slab-serif for pull quotes or callouts (e.g., Roboto Slab)

### Photography Style

* **Real, not stock** — Authentic adventure photography, not staged
* **Action and environment** — People doing things in real places
* **Diverse subjects** — Families, solo travelers, couples, all backgrounds
* **Gritty when appropriate** — Mud, scratches, worn gear — it's real
* **Beautiful landscapes** — Adventure happens in stunning places, show them

### Logo Direction

* Should work at all sizes (favicon to hero banner)
* Must be legible in one color (for watermarks, merch, etc.)
* Should evoke movement, adventure, or exploration
* Avoid overly complex or detailed illustrations
* Consider: compass elements, mountain/wave silhouettes, bold lettermark

*Logo design is TBD — guidelines here to inform future design work.*

## Content Formatting Standards

### Article Layout
* Strong headline (clear, no clickbait)
* Lead paragraph that hooks with practical value
* Scannable sections with clear subheads
* Bullet points for specs, lists, and quick references
* Images between sections (never walls of text)
* Clear CTA at the end (subscribe, read more, check gear)

### Affiliate Content
* Always labeled: "This article contains affiliate links"
* Recommendations must be genuine
* Include non-affiliate alternatives when relevant
* Never write content solely to push affiliate products

### Sponsored Content
* Clearly marked: "Sponsored by [Brand]" or "Message from Our Sponsor"
* Separated visually from editorial content
* Honest — sponsors don't buy our opinion

## Community Standards

* **Positive only** — Constructive discussion, no personal attacks
* **Moderated** — All user content reviewed before publishing
* **Family-friendly option** — Content flagged appropriately
* **No politics, no drama** — This is about adventure, nothing else
* **Respectful of nature** — Leave No Trace principles endorsed
