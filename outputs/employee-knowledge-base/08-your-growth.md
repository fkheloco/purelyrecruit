# 🌱 Your Growth

💡 **We invest in your development because your growth is our growth.** Here's how we support your career, learning, and professional development at Purely Works.

## Our Growth Philosophy

We believe:
- Everyone should be learning something new every month
- Growth isn't just about promotions — it's about skills, confidence, and impact
- The best way to learn is to do real work with real stakes
- Teaching others is one of the fastest ways to deepen your own expertise

## Learning Opportunities

### On-the-Job Learning

The majority of your growth will come from the work itself. We intentionally give people stretch assignments and new challenges.
- Work across different client projects to broaden your experience
- Pair with teammates who have different skill sets
- Take on responsibilities slightly beyond your current level
- Contribute to internal tools and processes

### AI Skill Development

As an AI-enabled company, we expect everyone to keep up with AI developments:
- Experiment with new AI tools as they launch
- Share discoveries in **#ai-experiments** on Slack
- Attend team AI workshops and knowledge-sharing sessions
- Build your own AI workflows to improve your productivity

### External Learning

We encourage and support external learning:
- Online courses and certifications relevant to your role
- Industry conferences and events
- Books, podcasts, and communities
- Talk to leadership about learning resources — we'll find a way to support it

## Feedback Culture

Feedback is how we get better. We treat it as a gift, not a threat.

### Giving Feedback

- **Be specific** — "The proposal intro was too long" beats "The proposal needs work"
- **Be timely** — share feedback close to the event
- **Focus on behavior, not personality** — "The report was missing data" not "You're careless"
- **Offer solutions** — "Here's how I'd approach it" alongside "Here's what I noticed"

### Receiving Feedback

- **Listen first** — resist the urge to defend immediately
- **Ask clarifying questions** — make sure you understand what's being said
- **Thank the person** — it takes courage to give honest feedback
- **Act on it** — the best response to feedback is visible improvement

### Regular Feedback Rhythms

| Cadence | What | Who |
|---|---|---|
| **Weekly** | Pod check-ins and project feedback | Pod leads + team |
| **Monthly** | 1:1 growth conversations | You + leadership |
| **Quarterly** | Performance review and goal setting | You + leadership |
| **Annually** | Comprehensive review and career planning | You + leadership |

## Career Growth at Purely Works

We're a small company — so career growth here looks different from a big corporation.

- Taking ownership of increasingly complex projects
- Becoming the go-to person for a specific skill or client
- Mentoring newer team members
- Leading a pod or initiative
- Expanding into new service areas
- Contributing to company strategy and direction

**What we look for when expanding responsibilities:**
- Consistent delivery quality
- Ownership mindset
- Proactive communication
- Willingness to help others grow
- Alignment with our values

---

## Setting Goals

We encourage everyone to set quarterly goals that cover:
- **Delivery goals** — what you'll accomplish for clients and the company
- **Learning goals** — what skills you'll develop
- **Contribution goals** — how you'll help teammates or improve processes

Discuss your goals with leadership during your monthly 1:1. We'll help you stay on track and remove blockers.

## A Note on Mistakes

Mistakes happen. They're part of doing ambitious work.

What matters is:
- **Own it** — don't hide it or make excuses
- **Fix it** — take immediate action to resolve the impact
- **Learn from it** — figure out what to do differently next time
- **Share it** — your mistake might save someone else from making the same one

We will never punish someone for making an honest mistake. We will absolutely address patterns of carelessness or lack of accountability.
