## Overall Scoring Thresholds

### 80-100 Points: STRONG GO
**Action:** Pursue aggressively
- Commit resources to quality proposal
- Develop comprehensive strategy
- Allocate senior team members
- Execute full gold team review process
- Schedule early Red Team review

**Rationale:** High strategic value, strong competitive position, acceptable risk, proven capability.

### 60-79 Points: CONDITIONAL GO
**Action:** Pursue with conditions or modifications
- Clarify scope or requirements via RFI
- Confirm team availability
- Develop specific win themes
- Consider teaming partnerships to address capability gaps
- May pursue if risk mitigation achieved
- Prioritize based on other pursuits

**Rationale:** Generally positive opportunity but requires validation or risk mitigation; consider pursuing conditionally or passing for higher-scoring opportunities.

### Below 60 Points: NO-GO
**Action:** Do not pursue
- Decline or pass on opportunity
- No proposal resources allocated
- Monitor for future iterations
- Maintain light relationship with client (if applicable)
- Consider for strategic relationship building only
