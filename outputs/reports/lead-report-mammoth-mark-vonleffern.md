**Angle**: Digital transformation trend + Mark's explicit tech passion + competitive pressure

▶ **Initial Message**:

```
Subject: AI for project controls dashboards?

Hi Mark,

I came across your profile while researching construction project controls firms, and your note about being "passionate about digital and technology solutions for capital projects" really stood out.

I've been helping a few project controls consultancies build AI-powered tools that automate the heavy lifting — things like auto-generating executive dashboards, analyzing contractor schedules for delays, and flagging risks before they become problems.

I was wondering if Mammoth has explored using AI to scale your PMIS and reporting services without adding headcount?

If you're curious, I'd be happy to show you what we've built for similar firms. Even if timing isn't right, I'm always excited to chat with someone who's thinking ahead on construction tech.

All the best,
Farid Kheloco

- **Day 14**: Reference his conference speaking, offer to collaborate on thought leadership

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We handle this in-house" | "That's great that you have the technical capability. What I've found with similar firms is that it's often the prioritization challenge — your team is billing hours on client work, so internal tool development gets deprioritized. We've helped firms treat internal tools as a strategic project with dedicated resources, while your team stays billable." |
| "Too expensive" | "I totally get budget sensitivity, especially for a firm your size. The way we typically structure this is to start with one high-ROI tool — maybe automating executive dashboard generation or schedule risk analysis — and show measurable time savings in 60-90 days. Then you can decide if expanding makes sense." |
| "Not the right time" | "I appreciate the honesty about timing. What I'm seeing across construction project controls is that digital transformation is accelerating — firms that move now are positioning as tech leaders. But I completely understand if you're mid-project or have other priorities. Can I check back in Q2/Q3?" |
| "We don't have internal tech resources" | "That's actually exactly why firms come to us. You shouldn't need a CTO or dev team to have modern tools. We build, deploy, and maintain everything — you just use it. Think of us as your fractional AI development team. Everything we create is 100% yours, no licensing fees." |
