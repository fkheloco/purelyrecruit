# Cathedral Center Value Propositions

## Primary Value Proposition

**"Cathedral Center transforms your recruiting and M&A process by making assessments feel like valuable consulting rather than sales."**

This core value proposition addresses the fundamental industry challenge: Most advisor M&A and recruiting processes are transactional, financial-metric-focused, and feel like evaluations or sales pitches. Cathedral Center inverts this by positioning assessment as a genuine consulting engagement that adds value regardless of partnership outcome.

## Value Quantification Examples

### Scenario 1: M&A Firm Evaluating Acquisition

**Situation:** Large advisory firm evaluating acquisition of smaller practice ($50M AUM)

**Financial:** Looks good ($2M annual revenue, healthy margins)

**Cathedral Center Assessment:** Reveals moderate culture alignment (68/100) and weak desires alignment (55/100 - owner wants to stay autonomous, but acquiring firm wants full integration)

**Value:** Identifies potential retention risk and integration challenges before $15M+ investment

**Outcome:** Firm either:
- Negotiates different integration approach based on insights
- Passes on deal due to identified risks
- Proceeds with eyes open and integration planning adjusted

### Scenario 2: Growing Firm Expanding Team

**Situation:** Mid-size advisory firm recruiting new advisors

**Traditional Approach:** Interview candidates, check production numbers, make offers

**Cathedral Center Approach:** 
- Assess behavioral fit (DAAN) for team composition
- Evaluate values alignment
- Match needs and desires to firm offering
- Predict integration success

**Value:** Higher retention, faster productivity ramp, better team fit

**Outcome:** 80%+ advisor retention vs. 60-70% industry average; faster advisor ramp-up
