## Common Objections & Responses

### "You're too small to handle this project"
**Response:** "Our boutique model is actually an advantage. We provide direct access to senior expertise, responsive decision-making, and flexible staffing. We've successfully delivered $2B+ in projects. Size is less important than expertise and responsiveness."

### "Larger firms have more resources"

### "Your DBE certification won't meet our MBE requirement"
**Response:** "Correct, we can't address every requirement independently, but we offer partnership opportunities where we serve as prime contractor with MBE partners, ensuring meaningful diversity commitment."
