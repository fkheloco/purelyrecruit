## How We're Organized: The Pod Model

We use a **pod-based structure** — small, focused teams organized by service line. Each pod operates semi-autonomously with clear ownership of their deliverables.

**Why pods?**
- Small teams move faster and make better decisions
- Clear ownership means no ambiguity about who's responsible
- Pods can scale independently as demand grows
- Cross-pod collaboration happens naturally because we're all in the same Slack workspace
