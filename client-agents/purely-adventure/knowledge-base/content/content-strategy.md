# Purely Adventure — Content Strategy

## Content Model

Purely Adventure operates on an **AI-first content model**. AI agents scan RSS feeds from 50-100+ adventure, overlanding, boating, and travel sources daily — then compile unique stories, news digests, product updates, and curated recommendations.

The founder oversees quality, direction, and editorial decisions. AI handles the heavy lifting.

## Daily Content Format

Each day, the platform publishes curated content across four categories:

* **Land** — Overlanding news, trail reports, vehicle builds, off-road gear updates
* **Sea** — Boating and sailing news, marine gear reviews, coastal destinations, boat tech
* **Air** — Aviation adventures, aerial exploration, drone content
* **Travel** — Adventure destinations, trip itineraries, budget tips, logistics

### Daily Digest Structure

Each category digest includes:
1. **Lead Story** — The most interesting or timely item of the day
2. **News Roundup** — 3-5 curated stories with AI-generated summaries
3. **Product Spotlight** — Gear update, new release, or review (with affiliate links where applicable)
4. **Community Pick** — User-submitted story, photo, or tip (once UGC is active)
5. **Sponsor Message** — Tasteful sponsor placement (when applicable)

## Content Types

* **Daily News Digests** — AI-curated daily stories per category
* **Destination Guides** — In-depth guides to adventure destinations
* **Gear Reviews** — Honest, practical reviews of overlanding, boating, and travel gear
* **Trip Itineraries** — Detailed trip plans with logistics, costs, and tips
* **How-To Guides** — Tutorials for beginners and intermediate adventurers
* **Product Updates** — New gear releases, industry news, tech updates
* **Adventure Stories** — Narratives from real adventures (AI-written and user-submitted)
* **Comparison Guides** — Gear vs. gear, destination vs. destination

## Content Sources

* RSS feeds from adventure, overlanding, boating, and travel publications
* Press releases from gear manufacturers and adventure companies
* User-generated content (moderated)
* Original AI-generated guides and reviews
* Competitor analysis and gap-filling content

## Publishing Workflow

1. AI scans RSS feeds daily (automated)
2. AI clusters and summarizes into category topics
3. AI generates platform-specific content (website, email, social)
4. Content queued for publishing schedule
5. Founder reviews flagged items (30-min daily review)
6. Content publishes automatically across all channels

## Agentic Publishing System

The system is designed to accept **.MD (Markdown) files** as input. The founder (or AI) drops an .MD file into the system and the agent handles:
* Formatting for the website
* Scheduling and publishing
* Social media distribution
* Email newsletter inclusion
* Affiliate link insertion where appropriate

## Content Quality Standards

* **Accuracy first** — All facts, specs, and claims must be verifiable
* **Practical value** — Every piece should help the reader plan, decide, or learn
* **Honest tone** — No paid-sounding language; if something is sponsored, say so
* **Family-friendly flagging** — Content tagged appropriately for audience filtering
* **No fluff** — Concise, scannable, get-to-the-point writing

## Editorial Calendar

* **Daily:** Category news digests (Land, Sea, Air, Travel)
* **Weekly:** 1-2 in-depth guides or reviews
* **Monthly:** Seasonal adventure roundups, gear buyer's guides
* **Ongoing:** User-submitted content as community grows

## Geographic Focus

Global — but likely starting with US-centric content and expanding based on audience demand.

## Experience Levels

Content serves all levels, with priority ordering:
1. **Beginners** — Getting started guides, gear basics, first-adventure planning
2. **Families** — Kid-friendly adventures, family-safe content
3. **Experienced Adventurers** — Advanced destinations, expert gear reviews, deep dives
