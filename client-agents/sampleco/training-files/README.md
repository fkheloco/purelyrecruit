Continuous Training Files

How it works
1. Drop new files (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, MD, TXT) into this folder
2. Ask the agent: "Process the new training files"
3. The agent reads files, updates knowledge-base, and moves processed files into previous-training/ with a timestamp

What to add
- New project docs and case studies
- Team bios and updates
- Client feedback and testimonials
- Updated processes and procedures
- Any new company information

Benefits
- Keeps knowledge base current without manual edits
- Maintains an audit trail of what was learned and when
- Simple workflow for non-technical users
