# PACT Methodology — Problem-Aware Collaborative Targeting

> **Purpose:** PACT is Purely Works' proprietary sales targeting framework. It guides how we identify, qualify, and engage prospects — always leading with their problem, positioning as a collaborative partner, and timing outreach to trigger events.

---

## The PACT Framework

### P — Problem-Aware
* Lead with the prospect's specific pain point, never our features
* Research before outreach: what's keeping this person up at night?
* Map pain points to specific Purely Works services
* Use their language, not ours

### A — Aligned
* Match our capabilities to their actual needs (not what we want to sell)
* Recommend the right entry service — usually Purely Flex ($6K/mo) unless they have a clear high-volume need
* Identify multi-service expansion potential but don't pitch everything at once
* Ensure genuine fit before pursuing (cultural fit matters)

### C — Collaborative
* Position as partner, not vendor
* Use "we" and "our" language
* Propose working together, not "selling to"
* Emphasize shared success metrics
* Frame engagement as "extension of your team"

### T — Trigger-Timed
* Outreach aligned to specific trigger events (funding, hiring, leadership change, lost deal, etc.)
* Fresh triggers get immediate outreach (within 48 hours)
* Stale triggers (60+ days) require re-validation
* Monitor for new triggers on Priority 2 prospects

* Office expansion or new market entry
* Revenue milestone announcements
* New product launches

### Pain Signals (MEDIUM-HIGH)
* Lost major bid/contract

## Engagement Sequence

### First Touch
* Reference specific trigger event
* Acknowledge their situation with empathy
* Connect to Purely Works capability (briefly)
* Offer value without asking for anything
* Suggest conversation, not a pitch

### Follow-Up (Day 7)
* Add new value (article, insight, case study)
* Light touch — "just wanted to share this"
* No pressure

### Final Attempt (Day 14)
* Direct but warm
* "I know timing is everything — happy to reconnect when it makes sense"
* Leave door open

## Service Entry Point Strategy

| ICP | Recommended Entry Service | Typical Starting Retainer |
|-----|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Construction | Proposal Services | $8K-15K/mo |
| Staffing | AI-Enhanced Recruiting | $5K-10K/mo |
| SaaS | Fractional Dev Team or AI Feature Project | $12K-20K/mo |
| Entertainment | Marketing/Content Production | $10K-15K/mo |
| Biotech | Grant Proposals or Marketing | $8K-25K/project |

**Default recommendation for uncertain fit:** Purely Flex at $6K/month — lets client test multiple services before committing to dedicated teams.

## Multi-Service Expansion Playbook

Year 1: Establish core service, prove ROI
Year 2: Add second service based on observed needs
Year 3: Full partnership across 3+ services

**Never pitch expansion until the first service is delivering clear value.**

*PACT ensures every outreach is relevant, respectful, and well-timed — building trust that converts to long-term partnerships.*
