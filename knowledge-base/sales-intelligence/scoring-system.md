## Scoring Best Practices

* Score every prospect before outreach — no exceptions
* Re-score Priority 2 prospects monthly for trigger changes
* Document reasoning for each score (not just the number)
* Adjust scores when new information emerges
* Track score-to-close correlation quarterly to calibrate the system

---

*Consistent scoring eliminates guesswork and ensures we focus energy where it has the highest probability of conversion.*
