## Design Elements & Patterns

### Wave Transitions
The site uses flowing, curved wave shapes to transition between sections (navy-to-white, white-to-navy). This creates a dynamic, organic feel that softens the contrast between sections.

### Button Styles
- **Primary CTA (Red):** Rounded pill shape, red `#DF2325` background, white text, uppercase
- **Primary CTA (Navy):** Rounded pill shape, navy `#172C4F` background, white text, uppercase
- **Secondary / Outline:** White background with navy or red border, matching text color
- **On dark backgrounds:** White pill button with navy text

### Card Styles
- Dark navy cards with slightly lighter navy backgrounds for separation
- White text for names and labels
- Red accent arrows or indicators

### Social Media Icons
- Circular red `#DF2325` backgrounds with white icon glyphs
- Platforms: LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook

## Application Guidelines

### Do
- Use Navy as the dominant color (60–70% of any composition)
- Use Red sparingly for CTAs and accents (10–15%)
- Maintain high contrast — white text on navy, navy text on white
- Use Poppins for all text (Bold for headlines, Regular for body)
- Keep layouts clean with generous whitespace
- Use wave/curve elements for section transitions when possible

### Don't
- Don't use Red as a background color for large areas (reserve for buttons and small accents)
- Don't use colors outside this palette without approval
- Don't mix multiple fonts beyond Poppins and Roboto
- Don't use pure black (`#000000`) at 100% opacity for body text — use 60-70% opacity
- Don't use the logo at sizes where the flame icon detail is lost
