## Central Brand Concept: The Four Fires

At the heart of LEAD Advisors' brand identity is the **Four-Fires visual motif** — representing four flames or fires that symbolize the holistic, multi-dimensional approach to leadership and business development.

The Four Fires represent:
- **Purpose Fire** — Why we lead, meaning beyond profit
- **People Fire** — Relationships, team, community
- **Physical Fire** — Health, energy, sustainability
- **Professional Fire** — Skills, strategy, results

This visual metaphor should appear consistently across all brand materials and communications. The flame icon in the logo directly references this concept.
