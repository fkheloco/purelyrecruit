# LEAD Advisors Outreach Templates

## Template Strategy

All outreach templates follow NEPQ principles: question-based, discovery-focused, values-aligned, not pitchy. Templates are starting points to be customized with specific company and research details.

---

## Template 1: Build Expo / Conference Follow-Up

**Use When:** Post-conference or trade show follow-up within 1-2 days of meeting

**Context:** Warm lead with personal connection made at event

---

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Quick follow-up from [Conference Name]"
- "Following up from our brief conversation at [Conference]"
- "[Your Name] here – enjoyed connecting at [Conference]"

**Email Body:**

Hi [Name],

I enjoyed our brief conversation at [Conference Name] last [day/week]. Your thoughts on [specific topic discussed at conference] stuck with me.

I've been reflecting on what you shared about [topic they mentioned], and I'm curious—what are your biggest challenges right now when it comes to [leadership/culture/management development]? Specifically, as you're growing and bringing people up into leadership roles, how are those transitions typically going?

I ask because at LEAD Advisors, we work with construction companies navigating exactly that kind of transition—and we've found some interesting patterns around what makes those transitions successful or challenging.

Are you open to a brief conversation about what we're seeing? No pressure at all—I'm genuinely curious about how things are going on your end.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. — If you're not the right person to talk to about leadership development or culture, do you know who might be?

---

**LinkedIn Variation (DM or Connection Request with Note):**

"Hi [Name], enjoyed connecting at [Conference]. I was intrigued by your thoughts on [topic]. Quick question: as you scale your team, what's been your biggest challenge around leadership transitions? Curious what you're seeing."

---

## Template 2: Job Posting Angle

**Use When:** Company is hiring for a leadership role, indicating growth or transition

**Context:** Identifies growth signal and development need

---

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Hiring for that [Role] at [Company]?"
- "Saw you're hiring for a [Leadership Role] – quick question"
- "[Company] leadership search – curious about something"

**Email Body:**

Hi [Name],

I noticed you're hiring for a [Director of Operations/VP Construction/Project Manager] position. Congratulations on the growth that prompted that.

A quick question: Beyond bringing in outside talent, are you also looking at developing your internal leaders? I ask because many of the construction companies we work with hire externally for leadership roles, but often they also need to develop existing supervisors and project managers who are stepping into bigger roles.

What's your approach been when promoting from within? How have those transitions typically gone?

We work with contractors specifically on making those transitions smoother—building capability and alignment in your existing team while you're also hiring externally.

Curious if that's something that would be valuable to explore.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. — If now's not the right time, I get it. But if you ever want to chat about leadership development, I'm here.

---

**LinkedIn Variation:**

"Saw the posting for [Leadership Role]. Cool that you're expanding the team! Question: are you working on developing existing leaders too, or focused on external hires? We help contractors navigate both. Always interested to connect."

---

## Template 3: Leadership Change Angle

**Use When:** New CEO, CFO, COO, or VP-level hire announced or identified

**Context:** Indicates leadership transition and potential need for alignment/integration

---

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Congrats on the new [Title]"
- "Welcoming your new [Leadership Role]"
- "[Name] – saw the leadership change at [Company]"

**Email Body:**

Hi [Name],

Congratulations on [bringing on your new CEO / promoting your VP / adding your CFO]! Leadership transitions at that level always create interesting opportunities and challenges.

I'm curious: what's their mandate in the first 90-180 days? What needs to shift or improve?

We work with contractors helping leadership navigate transitions like this—aligning the team, setting culture tone, developing the management bench. And we've found that companies who do that intentionally (rather than just hoping it works out) tend to see smoother transitions and faster value creation.

Given the transition happening now, would it make sense to have a brief conversation about what we're seeing with new leadership integrations? No agenda—just to see if there's something useful for you.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. — If this is a conversation better had with the new leader once they're onboarded, I totally understand. Happy to connect with them too.

---

**LinkedIn Variation:**

"Congrats on the new [Leader Name] joining as [Role]. What's their mandate? We help contractors navigate leadership transitions—often those intentional approaches pay off quickly."

---

## Template 4: Contract Win / Growth Milestone Angle

**Use When:** Company announces major contract win, expansion, or significant revenue milestone

**Context:** Indicates growth phase and organizational scaling needs

---

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Major win at [Company]!"
- "Saw the announcement about [Contract/Project] – impressive"
- "Growth opportunity question"

**Email Body:**

Hi [Name],

Congrats on the [contract win / project award / expansion announcement]! That's a meaningful milestone for [Company].

A question: when you're scaling to handle a win like that—more crew, more projects, more complexity—what's your approach to making sure your management team can scale with you?

We ask because we've seen a pattern: contractors nail the sales and project execution, but sometimes their management structure and leadership capability don't scale as fast as the business does. Then you end up with operational bottlenecks or culture issues.

We work with contractors specifically on that: developing the management team so your growth is actually sustainable.

Curious—as you're scaling with this new business, is leadership development on your radar?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. — Timing might not be right while you're executing on the new project. But if it is, we could help. Congrats again on the win.

---

**LinkedIn Variation:**

"Awesome announcement on [Contract/Project]! Question: as you scale, are you intentionally developing your management team to match the growth? That's where a lot of contractors run into challenges. We specialize in that."

---

## Template 5: Four-Fires Alignment Angle

**Use When:** Prospect shows cultural/values indicators (faith-based, family-owned, community involvement, values-driven messaging)

**Context:** Identifies cultural fit opportunity

---

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Love what you're building at [Company]"
- "Your company's culture/values caught my attention"
- "Leadership values at [Company]"

**Email Body:**

Hi [Name],

I was looking at [Company] and was really struck by your commitment to [specific value/mission mentioned on website or in news]. That kind of intentionality about culture and purpose isn't common in construction, and I think it's powerful.

Quick question: how deeply is that purpose/value embedded in how your managers and leaders show up? Are they aligned with it, or is it sometimes something that gets lost when you're busy executing?

We work with values-driven construction companies on making sure culture and purpose are actually lived out by the leadership team—not just talked about. We call it the "Four-Fires" approach: developing leaders across purpose, people, health, and professional capability.

Given what you're building at [Company], I'm curious if that's something that would resonate.

No pressure at all—just thought it might be worth a conversation.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. — If you resonate with this kind of approach, we'd love to chat. If not, no worries—I respect what you're doing either way.

---

**LinkedIn Variation:**

"Love your company's commitment to [value]. That's rare. Question: how aligned are your leaders with that culture? We help values-driven contractors make that real in leadership. Curious if you'd want to explore."

---

## Template 6: No Response Follow-Up – Gentle (Day 7)

**Use When:** Initial outreach received no response after 7 days

**Context:** First gentle follow-up without pressure

---

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Just following up – no worries if timing's off"
- "Quick follow-up on [Company Name]"
- "[Your Name] again – checking in"

**Email Body:**

Hi [Name],

I sent an email about a week ago but realize it might have gotten buried. No worries at all—I know inboxes are crazy.

I'm actually in town [specific city/date if relevant] and was thinking about what we discussed at [conference/previous context], and I'm still curious about [specific question].

If now's a good time to chat briefly, I'd love to. If not, I get it—just let me know.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. — If you'd rather not continue the conversation, just let me know and I'll remove you from my list. Either way, I respect your time.

---

**LinkedIn Variation:**

"Hi [Name], just following up on my message. I know timing isn't always right. But curious if you'd be open to a brief conversation about [topic]. No pressure—let me know."

---

## Template 7: No Response Follow-Up – Firmer (Day 14)

**Use When:** No response after first follow-up at day 7; second and likely final attempt

**Context:** More direct while still respectful

---

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Last follow-up – hope all is well"
- "One more attempt at connecting"
- "Final check-in"

**Email Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm going to make this my last attempt to connect—I know I might not be reaching you at the right time.

But I genuinely do think there might be something valuable for [Company] in what we do. We work specifically with contractors on [key value prop]. And based on what I know about [Company], it seems like the kind of thing that could move the needle for you.

If you'd like to explore that, here's my calendar link: [calendar link]. Grab 20 minutes if you're interested.

If now's just not the right time, I totally understand. Thanks for considering.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. — If I can ever be helpful in another way down the road, feel free to reach out. And if this isn't a fit at all, I'll respectfully step back.

---

**LinkedIn Variation:**

"Hi [Name], this is my final attempt. I genuinely think we could help [Company]. Open for a brief conversation? If not, no worries—I'll step back."

---

## Template 8: Referral Follow-Up

**Use When:** Someone referred you to a prospect; warm introduction with credibility

**Context:** Higher trust and credibility from referral

---

**Subject Line Options:**
- "[Referrer Name] suggested I reach out"
- "Introduction from [Referrer Name] at [Company]"
- "[Referrer Name] thought we should connect"

**Email Body:**

Hi [Name],

[Referrer Name] at [Company] recently mentioned you and [Company], and suggested we might have a good conversation about leadership development.

[Referrer Name] has been great to work with on [specific project/initiative], and he thought what we do might be valuable for your leadership team as well.

Would you be open to a brief conversation? I'm flexible on timing—happy to work around your schedule.

Either way, thanks for considering, and say hi to [Referrer] for me.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Contact info]

**LinkedIn Variation:**

"[Referrer Name] mentioned you. He thought we might have a good conversation about how we help contractors develop their leadership teams. Open to a quick chat?"

## Customization Checklist

Before sending any template, customize by:

- [ ] Use prospect's actual name and company name
- [ ] Reference specific detail about their company (recent news, growth, values, etc.)
- [ ] Personalize the "why I'm reaching out" section
- [ ] Use their industry language and context (if construction, mention construction-specific challenges)
- [ ] Include specific question that shows research (not generic)
- [ ] Adjust tone to match company culture (formal construction company vs. casual tech company)
- [ ] Use first name only if relationship warrants; otherwise [First Last]
- [ ] Verify email address and correct contact
- [ ] Keep length reasonable (short enough to read in 2 minutes)
- [ ] Include clear next step (calendar link, specific question, etc.)
- [ ] Sign with genuine personal note if appropriate

---

## Subject Line Principles

**Effective Subject Lines:**
- Show clear reason for reaching out (not vague)
- Create curiosity without being clickbaity
- Reference mutual connection or shared context
- Short and scannable
- Personalized (their name, company name, or shared context)

**Avoid:**
- "Hi there" or "Hello"
- Urgency language ("URGENT!", "Quick question!")
- Questions without context ("Can I ask you something?")
- All caps (except proper nouns)
- Misleading or false urgency

---

## Response Handling

### If They Respond with "Not interested"
- Thank them genuinely
- Ask if timing might be different in the future
- Add to nurture list for quarterly check-in
- Leave door open: "Appreciate your candor. If something changes, happy to connect."

### If They Say "Now's not the right time"
- Respect it: "I hear you—totally understand."
- Ask when might be better: "When do you think it might make sense to revisit this?"
- Calendar a follow-up for that time
- Don't push

### If They Ask for More Information
- Don't dump all information
- Ask a discovery question instead
- "Before I send anything over, quick question: what would be most valuable to understand?"
- Moves to conversation, not information dump

### If They Suggest Your Solution Doesn't Fit
- Don't argue
- Ask clarifying question: "Help me understand what you're thinking..."
- May uncover misunderstanding
- May genuinely not be fit—respect that

---

## Outreach Sequence (Multi-Touch)

**Day 1-2:** Email with question-based outreach
**Day 7:** Light follow-up if no response
**Day 14:** Final direct follow-up
**Day 21+:** Move to quarterly nurture (monthly resource or check-in)

If they engage in any way, move to discovery conversation immediately.

All outreach should feel like genuine interest in their success, not a sales sequence pushing them into a funnel.
