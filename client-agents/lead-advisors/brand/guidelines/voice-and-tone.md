# LEAD Advisors Voice & Tone Guidelines

## Core Brand Voice

LEAD Advisors communicates as a **trusted advisor and strategic partner** in construction industry leadership development. Our voice is:

- **Professional yet faith-friendly:** Respectful, values-oriented, and inclusive without being preachy
- **Authoritative but approachable:** Expert knowledge delivered with genuine care
- **Question-based and exploratory:** We guide through strategic inquiry, not prescription
- **Grounded in the Four Fires philosophy:** Holistic, multi-dimensional, whole-person focused
- **Authentic and values-driven:** Honest about our commitment to exceptional culture building

## Core Methodology: NEPQ (7th Level)

LEAD Advisors employs the NEPQ (Never-Ending Progressive Questions) methodology from 7th Level. This question-based approach is foundational to our voice:

- **Lead with questions, not answers:** Strategic inquiry precedes recommendations
- **Empower through exploration:** Help clients discover their own insights
- **Encourage continuous learning:** Frame challenges as opportunities for growth
- **Develop whole-person leaders:** Questions address all Four Fires dimensions

### How NEPQ Shapes Our Voice

Instead of:
- "You need to implement this system..."
- **Ask:** "What would change if your team approached decisions this way?"

Instead of:
- "Here's the best practice..."
- **Ask:** "How might your culture shift if leaders asked better questions?"

Instead of:
- "Your company should focus on..."
- **Ask:** "Across all Four Fires, where do you see the greatest opportunity?"

## Tone Checklist

- [ ] Do we sound professional but approachable?

## Examples by Context

### Email Introduction to Prospect
**Subject: Strategic Question About Your Leadership Culture**

"Hi [Name],

I was impressed by [specific observation about their company/leadership]. I'm curious: if you could strengthen one dimension of your leadership culture over the next year, where would you focus?

That question sits at the heart of what we do at LEAD Advisors. We work with construction leaders to develop exceptional cultures through strategic questioning and what we call the Four-Fires approach—a holistic framework that addresses leadership across all dimensions.

Rather than tell you what to do, we'd like to ask better questions.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about your leadership development goals?

Best,
[Name]"

### Case Study Introduction
"When [Company Name] engaged LEAD Advisors, their leaders asked themselves a critical question: 'Are we developing our team with the same intentionality we bring to our projects?' Their journey toward exceptional culture didn't happen through a new system or initiative. It happened through strategic questions and a commitment to the Four Fires—developing the whole person across all dimensions of leadership.

Here's what changed..."

### Post-Engagement Communication
"Over the past quarter, I've watched your team grow. The strategic questions you're asking in leadership meetings are different now. More curious. More focused on whole-person development. That's not coincidence—that's the Four Fires in action. Let's talk about what's next..."
