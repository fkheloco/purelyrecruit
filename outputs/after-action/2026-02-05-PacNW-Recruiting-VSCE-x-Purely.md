**Date:** February 5, 2026 | **Time:** 10:00 AM PST

## SECTION 1: AFTER-ACTION REPORT

### Executive Summary
First full team sync between VSCE and Purely Works recruiting teams for Pacific Northwest recruitment initiative. Armeen Haroon presented the recruitment workflow, demonstrating the manual shortlisting + AI scoring system currently processing 9-10 candidates. Allen Wong (via audio) prioritized redirecting all efforts to Seattle/Sound Transit area and emphasizing relationship-building over transactional staffing. The team agreed to score all current candidates before Allen's Asia trip, then scale to full capacity targeting PacNW with contingent hiring framework.

### Key Decisions
- **Recruitment Focus:** Shift all Indeed postings from California to Seattle/Pacific Northwest (Sound Transit area)
- **Scoring Priority:** Complete extraction and AI scoring of all 10 current candidates by end of day/next day for Allen Wong to independently review
- **Contingent Hiring Model:** Add screening question about candidate interest in contingency hire (offer before job win)
- **Job Postings:** Update Indeed listings with Seattle location and generic salary ranges (researched)
- **Data Collection:** Collect real contact info (emails, phone numbers) from candidates (Indeed provides masked data)
- **Relationship Model:** Position as extension of VSCE recruiting team, not staffing agency—focus on long-term relationship building
- **Platform Evolution:** Plan 6-month migration from Airtable/Softr to custom database and UI
- **Half-Share Model:** Maintain 2-3 candidate pipeline approach with flexible capacity for PacNW headhunting

### Full Combined Notes

**Introductions & Context**
- Farid opened as first full project sync with client
- Introduced Armeen Haroon, Head of Recruiting at Purely Works (company's first employee, holds all roles)
- Allen Wong requested meeting before Asia trip to understand project status and provide guidance
- Bill Ulmer contributed recruiting expertise (sold aircraft maintenance recruiting company, now consultant with $200M parent company managing 97 open requisitions)

**Recruitment Workflow Overview**
- Generic job descriptions created for construction positions: Signal Design/Inspector, Scheduler, Office Engineers, Document Control, Estimator
- Posted under "Talent Ocean" (Purely Works' backend sister company) on Indeed
- Manual shortlisting by 3-person recruiting team, then AI-based extraction and scoring
- AI provides recommendation (Not Recommended / Recommended / Highly Recommended) + score
- Human review layer required as AI scores don't always align with recruiter assessment
- Currently 9-10 applicants ready for scoring

**Indeed Postings Issue**
- Discovered postings incorrectly listed location as California instead of Pacific Northwest
- Must provide location to Talent Ocean backend for proper submissions
- Salary ranges: using generic research-based ranges
- Screening questions include: expected salary, work location, work sponsorship needs
- Questions partially mandatory (experience level), partially optional (salary expectations—70% answer rate)

**Candidate Screening Process**
- AI extraction panel: pulls resume data, matching to role requirements
- AI scoring panel: generates recommendation and score
- Human notes layer: recruiters flag discrepancies between AI and own assessment
- Discrepancies feed back into algorithm refinement
- Client interface separate from backend—recruiter notes and client notes tracked separately
- All candidate records persist; qualified candidates auto-rescored for new jobs

**"Briefcase of Confidence" Strategy**
- Goal: provide Allen/Jesus with 30+ fresh, scored, verified resumes for Seattle area
- Not hiring for specific opening—building confidence to walk into meetings with strong candidate pool
- Contingent offer letters sent after interview to strengthen offer
- Add Indeed screening question: "Would you be interested in a contingency hire?"
- Contingency hire = interview and offer before job is won; placement when job is secured

**Data Collection & Verification**
- Indeed masks email addresses—must collect real contact info from candidates
- Process: request contact details via Indeed message or screening response
- Forward compiled list to VSCE for phone verification (confirm real person, not full interview)
- Alternative solutions discussed: preliminary video interview link, AI outbound dialer for quick verification

**Relationship-Building Philosophy** (Allen's emphasis)
- Small industry—first touchpoint should build relationships, not act as transactional staffing agency
- Many candidates ready 3-5 years from now; invest in those relationships
- Purely Works acts as extension of VSCE recruiting team, handling pre-work and calendar setup
- Initial call should come from VSCE team member (not recruiter), establishing warmth and filter credibility
- White-glove treatment preferred for high-value candidates

**Technology & Infrastructure**
- Current: Airtable + Softr backend, Indeed + LinkedIn inflow (largely manual, 2-3x daily checks)
- Planned: 6-month migration to custom database and UI
- Resume formatter: auto-formats to client specs (e.g., LA format with character limits); outputs to Google Docs for edits
- Cost pressure: Indeed costs rising; exploring sales-route approach (ZoomInfo, Apollo, proprietary talent DB)
- Indeed loophole: free postings available from Pakistan to supplement paid US postings

**Positions Currently Recruiting**
- Construction Estimator
- Transit & Infrastructure Signal Design/Inspector
- Construction Scheduler
- Office Engineer / Document Control
- General construction roles (with custom options for specialized positions like Resident Engineers)

**Side Discussion: Insurance Agent Recruiting** (Bill Ulmer + Farid)
- Bill interested in recruitment services for insurance agent placement
- Goal: 10 phone calls per week
- Discussed pricing models: $20/call initially proposed; explored $1,500/month possibilities
- High industry turnover: 300,000 licensed agents in US; many move annually
- Bill's goal: build agency of 300 agents by end of 2027
- Previous success: 50 applicants per 5 days without robots
- Potential models: talent pool with resale ($40/lead to other agencies), $500/month qualified delivery service
- Farid proposed fractional team resale model (multiple clients sharing one recruitment team)

**Timeline & Deliverables**
- Scored candidate list: ready end of day 2/5 or morning 2/6
- Allen's independent scoring: before Asia departure
- Full PacNW recruitment push: during Allen's Asia trip (week of 2/10+)
- Return to base: Allen reviews 37+ scored resumes upon return

## SECTION 2: CLIENT RECAP DRAFT

**FROM:** Farid Kheloco (farid@purelyworks.com)
**RE:** PacNW Recruiting | VSCE x Purely – First Full Team Sync
**DATE:** February 5, 2026

Hi Allen,

Appreciate you joining us for the full team sync—great to have Bill and Armeen in the room for the first time. Here's where we landed:

**What We've Built**
Armeen and the team have the recruiting database live and processing candidates. We've got 9-10 applicants currently ready for scoring using our AI extraction and scoring system. The manual shortlisting + AI hybrid approach is working well, and we're already seeing good signal on recommendation accuracy.

**What We're Fixing**
Found that Indeed listings were set to California—we're pivoting all postings to Seattle/Sound Transit immediately with researched salary ranges and the contingency hire screening question you requested. This should get us pointed in the right direction for the PacNW market.

**The Ask Before Your Trip**
Would be great if you could independently score the 10 candidates by end of week—your feedback on AI accuracy will help us refine the engine while you're in Asia. Armeen can have them ready by tomorrow morning. Once you review, we'll flip the recruitment machine to full capacity and have 30+ fresh, scored resumes waiting when you get back. That's the briefcase of confidence you need to walk into meetings.

**Next Steps**
- Score 10 candidates + provide feedback (you)
- Update postings & add contingency question (Armeen)
- Collect real contact info from candidates (our team)
- VSCE reviews scored candidates for accuracy (your team)
- Full recruitment push during your trip (our team)

The relationship-building piece you emphasized really resonates with how we operate—we're positioning as an extension of your recruiting team, not a staffing agency. First touchpoint should come from VSCE, with candidates pre-filtered and warmed up.

Let's connect after you review the candidates and get your thoughts on the scoring—happy to adjust the system based on what you see.

All the best,
Farid
