## Business Characteristics

### Critical Pain Points
1. **Content Production at Scale** — Producing multiple projects simultaneously; coordinating hundreds of hours of footage, creative assets
2. **Marketing Automation & Speed** — Need to promote content across platforms (streaming launches, theatrical releases, social)
3. **Pitch/Proposal Preparation** — Pitching to studios, networks, platforms; competitive landscape; high stakes
4. **Post-Production Efficiency** — Color grading, sound design, VFX render times, subtitle generation, clip extraction
5. **Talent Acquisition & Onboarding** — Crew hiring, contract negotiation, onboarding (50+ people per production typical)
6. **AI Content Policy Clarity** — Union concerns (WGA strike 2023, SAG-AFTRA); unclear on what AI applications are permissible
7. **Marketing Overwhelm** — Small teams managing huge content libraries; need to extract clips, generate captions, create social content

### Current Technology Stack
* **Production Tools:** Adobe Creative Suite (Premiere, After Effects), Avid Media Composer, Final Cut Pro
* **Post-Production:** DaVinci Resolve (color), Adobe Audition (sound), various VFX suites (Nuke, Motion)
* **Asset Management:** Frame.io (review/collaboration), Dropbox/Google Drive (basic), Artisan or MediaSilo (enterprise)
* **Project Management:** Monday.com, Asana, Notion (varying maturity)
* **AI Tools:** Runway ML, Midjourney (experimental), ElevenLabs (voice), limited AI integration
* **Distribution:** YouTube, Vimeo, streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV+)

### Buying Triggers
* Major production deal requiring rapid deliverables (TV series, streaming film)
* "Do more with less" mandate from executives; budget cuts requiring efficiency
* Competitor announcing AI-powered content; market differentiation threat
* Marketing team overwhelmed; need automated social content
* Streaming launch date; need rapid clip extraction, thumbnail generation, captions
* Post-production backlog; color/sound work delayed
* Talent shortage on crew (traditional crews hard to hire)

### Common Objections & Counter-Arguments

| Objection | Counter |
|-----------|---------|
| "Our creative process is bespoke; can't be automated" | "Agreed. We're not automating creative decisions. We're automating the admin (clipping, captioning, social sizing, format conversion). Directors focus on creative." |
| "Union concerns; SAG-AFTRA and WGA rules on AI" | "We focus on post-production admin, marketing, and crew hiring—non-union-covered areas. Voice synthesis stays off-talent voices. Content review stays with humans." |
| "AI-generated content looks fake; audiences will hate it" | "We're not replacing human creators. We're speeding up tedious tasks (subtitle timing, thumbnail generation, social clip extraction). Human creative remains." |
| "This doesn't fit our workflow" | "We work backward from your processes. We integrate with your tools (Frame.io, Adobe, Monday.com), not replace them." |
| "Entertainment industry moves fast; implementation risk is high" | "6-week pilot on one project proves ROI. Zero risk if you hate it. Most clients expand after first project." |

## Sales & Marketing Approach

### Messaging Framework

**Headline:** "Automate the Busywork. Keep the Creativity."

**Positioning:**
* Not a creative tool. A production team extension.
* Automate marketing asset generation, social clipping, crew hiring—so directors focus on directing.
* All content stays with you. Creative control remains.

**Core Benefits:**
1. **Speed:** Marketing assets in weeks (not months); crew hired faster
2. **Cost Efficiency:** Reduce post-production admin by 60-70%
3. **Creative Focus:** Directors/producers spend time on creative, not logistical admin
4. **Scalability:** Handle multiple concurrent projects without proportional team growth
5. **Union-Safe:** Non-union-covered work; respects WGA/SAG-AFTRA boundaries

### Outreach Channels

**High-Priority Channels:**
1. **Warm Introductions** — Industry networks, production company referrals, entertainment VCs
2. **LinkedIn Prospecting** — Target producers, COOs, heads of production with entertainment thought leadership
3. **Industry Events** — Sponsor/speak at producer guilds, entertainment finance forums
4. **Direct Outreach** — Email + call to producers, COOs at target companies (warm intros > cold)
5. **Production Community** — Build relationships in LA entertainment scene (events, guilds, associations)
6. **Content Marketing** — Case studies on marketing campaigns, production efficiency

**Lower-Priority Channels:**
* Google Ads (low targeting for niche audience)
* Cold calling without warm intro (low response)

### Sales Cycle Expectations

**Timeline:** 60-90 days from first touch to signed project agreement (long sales cycle due to production complexity)

| Stage | Duration | Activities |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Awareness → Interest | 2-3 weeks | LinkedIn/event, warm intro, discovery call |
| Qualification | 1-2 weeks | Project assessment, pain point validation |
| Pilot/Proof Concept | 2-3 weeks | Small pilot project (marketing assets for one film/series) |
| Negotiation | 1-2 weeks | Project scope, pricing, team assignment |
| Closure | 1 week | Signed project agreement, onboarding |

**Close Rates:**
* Warm intro (producer network, VC referral): 30-40%

* Average: 15-20%

## Union & Compliance Considerations

**Critical Awareness:**
* **WGA (Writers Guild of America)** — 2023 strike focused on AI; union has rules on AI usage in scripts, content
* **SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild)** — Rules on synthetic voices, AI-generated imagery of actors
* **IATSE (International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees)** — Production crew union; emerging AI policies

**Safe Areas for AI Application:**
* Marketing asset generation (thumbnails, clips, captions) — typically non-union
* Post-production admin (file organization, asset management) — non-union
* Crew recruiting support — non-union
* Pitch/proposal optimization — non-union

**Avoid/Caution:**
* Script generation or editing — WGA-covered; sensitive
* AI-generated actor faces/voices — SAG-AFTRA-covered; restricted
* Automated color grading or VFX — IATSE-adjacent; caution
