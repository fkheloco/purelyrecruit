**Core Function:** Cathedral Center evaluates and engages financial advisors and practices through evidence-based, three-tier assessments, transforming the recruiting and M&A process from transactional evaluation to valuable consulting engagement.

### Value Proposition

**"Cathedral Center transforms your recruiting and M&A process by making assessments feel like valuable consulting rather than sales."**
