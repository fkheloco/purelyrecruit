# Purely Adventure — Social Media & Marketing Strategy

## Platform Priority (Ranked)

### Tier 1: Primary Platforms

#### 1. Reddit
* **Why:** Highly engaged niche communities for overlanding, sailing, and boating. Daily digest format works perfectly. Strong click-through traffic to websites.
* **Communities:** r/overlanding, r/sailing, r/boating, r/adventuretravel, r/vanlife
* **Content Format:** Text-based daily digest posts with formatted summaries and source links
* **Frequency:** 1 post per relevant subreddit daily
* **Automation:** PRAW (Python) or IFTTT for automated posting from RSS pipeline
* **Solo Operator Fit:** Minimal interaction required; algorithm rewards consistent, valuable posts

#### 2. YouTube (Shorts + Community Tab)
* **Why:** 2nd largest platform globally. YouTube search brings organic discovery traffic. Adventure content performs exceptionally well.
* **Content Format:**
  * YouTube Shorts: 60-90 second highlight reels from daily stories
  * Community Tab: Text-based daily digest posts (similar to Reddit)
  * Weekly Video: 5-10 minute narrative digest (longer-form)
* **Frequency:** 1 Short daily + 1 Community post daily + 1 weekly video
* **Automation:** AI video generation (Synthesia/Descript) + YouTube API via Zapier
* **Solo Operator Fit:** Shorts can be auto-generated from text. Community tab is fully automatable.

#### 3. Instagram (Reels + Feed)
* **Why:** Overlanding and boating communities thrive on Instagram. Strong visual content platform.
* **Content Format:**
  * Reels: 15-60 second video clips with text overlays
  * Feed: Carousels or single images with digest highlights
  * Stories: Ephemeral daily updates with CTA links
* **Frequency:** 1-2 Reels daily + 1-2 feed posts + Story updates
* **Automation:** SocialPilot or Publer for scheduling. Canva API for image generation.
* **Solo Operator Fit:** 70-80% automatable with scheduling tools

#### 4. Email Newsletter (Owned Channel)
* **Why:** Direct audience ownership. Perfect format match for daily news digests. Best monetization channel.
* **Content Format:** Daily morning email digest with 5-8 curated stories per category
* **Frequency:** Daily (7 AM send time optimal)
* **Automation:** 100% automatable via RSS.app or Zapier → Beehiiv/EmailOctopus
* **Solo Operator Fit:** Set-and-forget automation. Most reliable channel.

### Tier 2: Monitor & Build

#### 5. Bluesky
* **Why:** Growing platform with open API. Users migrating from X/Twitter. Fresh audience building opportunity.
* **Content Format:** Thread-style daily digests
* **Frequency:** Daily posts
* **Automation:** API integrations developing; IFTTT expected
* **Status:** Monitor and post when tools mature. Don't prioritize initially.

### Not Recommended (for now)

* **TikTok:** High engagement but audience misaligned with overlanding/boating niche. Algorithm prioritizes trends over news aggregation. Difficult to drive website traffic.
* **Facebook:** Lowest engagement for this niche. Better for B2C retail, not content aggregation.
* **LinkedIn:** Too professional/B2B focused.
* **Pinterest:** Better for lifestyle/aspirational content, not daily news aggregation.

### Email (Subscriber Growth)
