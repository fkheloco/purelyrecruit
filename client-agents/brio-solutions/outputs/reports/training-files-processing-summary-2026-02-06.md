## Major Strategic Findings

### 1. Business Model Transformation

**From:** Direct sales to government agencies (transit authorities, DOT, utilities)

**To:** Teaming partnerships with prime contractors as specialized sub-contractor

**Rationale:**
* Brio too small to compete directly vs. Big 4 consulting firms
* Government agencies prefer larger firms with established relationships
* Prime contractors win major contracts but need specialized PMIS partners
* Faster sales cycles, higher win probability, recurring revenue

**Financial Target:**
* **Year 1 Revenue:** $700K run-rate by Q4 2026
* **3 concurrent sub-contracts** @ $200K/year each
* **Gross margin:** 40-50%

---

### 2. Ideal Partner Profiles (IPP) - 5 Categories

#### IPP #1: Large Engineering & Consulting Firms
**Examples:** HNTB, WSP, ARCADIS, HDR
**Annual Revenue:** $500M-$5B+
**Why They Partner:** Win $50M contract with PMIS component; lack in-house Oracle Unifier expertise
**Engagement:** 18-24 month PMIS implementations on transit/infrastructure projects

#### IPP #2: Program Management Consulting (PMC) Firms
**Examples:** Booz Allen Hamilton, Deloitte Consulting, AECOM Management
**Why They Partner:** PMC contract requires PMIS; not their core expertise
**Engagement:** PMIS workstream while PMC manages overall program

#### IPP #3: Software & IT Consulting (Systems Integrators)
**Examples:** Deloitte, Accenture, Oracle Consulting, EY
**Why They Partner:** Large ERP program; PMIS is one module; need specialist
**Engagement:** PMIS workstream within broader digital transformation

#### IPP #4: Construction Management & General Contractors
**Examples:** Turner, Balfour Beatty, Kiewit, Skanska
**Why They Partner:** Client demands sophisticated controls; not contractor's specialty
**Engagement:** Project controls and PMIS for complex construction programs

#### IPP #5: Specialized Controls & Analytics Consultants
**Examples:** Boutique EVM and controls firms
**Why They Partner:** Controls scope includes PMIS; want to stay in methodology lane
**Engagement:** Partner handles PMIS tech; Brio handles controls methodology
