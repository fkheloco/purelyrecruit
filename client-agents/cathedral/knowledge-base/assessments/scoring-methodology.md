# Cathedral Center Compatibility Scoring Methodology

## Overview

Cathedral Center employs a comprehensive DNA scoring system that moves beyond financial metrics to assess true partnership compatibility across quantitative and qualitative dimensions. The system generates a 0-100 compatibility score combining quantitative (financial), qualitative (cultural), and financial metrics (FM) scoring.

## Compatibility Scoring Model

### Scale Definition

**0-10 Matching/Compatibility Scale (Accretive, Not Binary)**

The assessment uses an accretive scale where each dimension is scored 0-10, and importance weights are applied as multipliers based on stated priorities.

### Importance Slider Multiplier

Each assessment dimension includes an importance multiplier reflecting stated priority:

| Priority Level | Multiplier | Application |
|---|---|---|
| **Utmost** | 10 pts | Critical to the partnership; non-negotiable |
| **Very Important** | 7.5 pts | Important factor in decision-making |
| **Kind of Important** | 5 pts | Moderate importance; nice to have |
| **Not Very Important** | 2.5 pts | Lower priority; acceptable trade-off |
| **Zero** | 0 pts | Not considered in evaluation |

**Calculation:** Dimension Score × Importance Multiplier = Weighted Score

## Quantitative Dimensions (Financial Metrics)

Financial metrics establish baseline compatibility on business fundamentals.

### Revenue Model Alignment

**Scale:** Fee Only → Fee Driven → Hybrid → Commission Driven → Commission Only
