# 🏢 About Us

💡 **Purely Works is an AI-enabled services company.** We combine AI technology with human expertise to help businesses scale — without the enterprise price tag.

---

## Our Mission

We help businesses scale through AI-augmented teams. Our approach is simple: **AI does the initial work, humans refine and deliver.** This lets us move faster, deliver higher quality, and keep costs reasonable for mid-market companies that don't have Big 4 budgets.

---

## What We Do

We offer five core services — internally we call them **The Big Five:**

| Service | What It Means | Color |
|---|---|---|
| **Proposals** | AI-powered RFP/SOQ response, especially for construction firms | 🔵 Pacific Blue |
| **Development** | Custom software and AI development (fractional teams) | 🔴 Soft Purple |
| **Consulting** | AI strategy, business advisory, implementation | 🟠 Fire Bush |
| **Recruiting** | Talent acquisition with AI-enhanced matching | 🟢 Keppel |
| **Marketing** | AI-enabled content and campaign support | 🟡 Fuzzy Wuzzy Brown |

Each service operates as a **pod** — a small, focused team with autonomy to deliver great work.

## How We're Different

- **AI as accelerator, humans as finishers** — we never say "AI replaces people"
- **Client ownership** — clients own 100% of all code, data, and IP we create
- **Flexible fractional teams** — clients scale up or down monthly
- **Month-to-month agreements** — no long-term lock-in
- **Partnership approach** — we're an extension of the client's team, not a vendor
- **Remote-global capability** — US leadership + Pakistan operations team for 24/7 productivity

---

## Our Business Model

- **Monthly retainers:** $5K-$15K per client, plus project-based work
- **Target:** $100K+ MRR by September 2026
- **Current team:** ~14 core members, scaling to 20
- **Key clients:** VSCE Inc. (construction), CM Solutions (construction), Brio Solutions (recruiting/PM)
- **Tech stack:** HubSpot (CRM), Linear (PM), GitHub (Dev), Google Workspace, Slack, AI-everywhere

---

## Where We're Going

We're building a company where **every service line is AI-enhanced from day one.** Our goal isn't just to deliver services — it's to fundamentally change how mid-market companies think about scaling with AI.

**2026 priorities:**
- Scale to $100K+ monthly recurring revenue
- Grow the team to 20 people across all pods
- Deepen our construction and staffing industry expertise
- Build repeatable AI tools that create compounding value for clients
