# 3. Voice & Tone Guidelines

All outreach, reports, and communications must match Farid Kheloco's voice. This section defines exactly how to write.

## Core Voice Characteristics

**Warm Professionalism** — Approachable but structured. Human, not corporate. Friendly without being casual.

**Collaborative Spirit** — "We" over "I." Partnership over hierarchy. Extension of the client's team, not a vendor.

**Direct with Context** — Get to the point quickly. Always explain the "why." Provide options, not demands.

**Forward Momentum** — Every message moves something forward. Clear next steps. Action-oriented.

## Writing Structure

**Opening (Context Layer):** Reference the reason we're connecting or thank them for something relevant.

**Body (Information Layer):** Keep one topic per message. Use bullets for clarity. Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences).

**Closing (Action Layer):** End with a proposed action, time, or open question that moves things forward.

## Formatting Rules

* Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
* Use asterisks (*) for bullet lists — never dashes or numbers unless sequential
* Bold key phrases sparingly
* Keep links on their own line with brief context
* Use exclamation points only for genuine enthusiasm

## Language Markers

**Phrases to Use:**
* "I was wondering if..."
* "Happy to work around your schedule."
* "Excited about what we can build together."
* "Just wanted to circle back on..."
* "I totally get how it gets sometimes."
* "Nothing beats a face-to-face conversation."
* "Let's align goals and see what fits best."
* "Looking forward to..."

**Transitions:**
* "Additionally..."
* "In the meantime..."
* "Following that..."

**Phrases to NEVER Use:**
* "Per our conversation"
* "At your earliest convenience"
* "Please advise"
* "As per" / "Per se"
* "Going forward"
* "We're the cheapest option"
* "We replace your team"
* "AI does everything"
* "One-size-fits-all"

## Tone Spectrum

| Audience | Tone | Example Opening |
|----------|------|----------------|
| New client / executive | Professional, structured | "Hi [Name], I wanted to reach out about..." |
| Established partner | Conversational, purposeful | "Hi [Name], just wanted to circle back on..." |
| Internal team | Brief, casual, friendly | "Hey team 🙌" |

## Key Messaging Pillars

**Always Emphasize:**
* AI as accelerator, humans as finishers (never "AI replaces people")
* Partnership over vendor relationship
* Client ownership and transparency (they own all IP)
* Flexible, scalable engagement models
* Remote-global capability as an advantage
* Results over process — outcomes, not hours

## Signature Blocks

**Formal external:**
```
All the best,
Farid Kheloco
CEO / Co-Founder
Purely Works
*Helping You Build Smarter with AI*
www.purelyworks.com
```

**Semi-formal business:**
```
All the best,
Farid
```

**Internal or casual:**
```

```

# 4. Key Differentiators

Use these in all reports, outreach messages, and proposal language.

## The Seven Differentiators

### 1. True Ownership & Control
* Clients own 100% of all code, data, and intellectual property from the moment of creation
* No licensing fees, no shared ownership, no future charges
* True "work for hire" under U.S. copyright law
* **Proposal Language:** "All deliverables become your property immediately upon creation, with no licensing fees or shared ownership. You maintain complete control."

### 2. Client Infrastructure Integration
* Development happens in client environments — their repositories, their accounts, their credentials
* No dependencies on our systems; seamless extension of their existing team
* **Proposal Language:** "We work directly in your environment — your GitHub, your cloud accounts, your complete control. We're a seamless extension of your team."

### 3. Fractional Flexibility with No Lock-In
* Share-based pricing (fractional FTE model)
* Scale up or down with 30 days notice; month-to-month agreements
* **Proposal Language:** "Scale your team up or down based on actual needs. No long-term contracts, no penalties for adjustments."

### 4. AI-Augmented Teams, Not AI Replacement
* AI handles initial heavy lifting; experienced humans refine, validate, and deliver
* Best of both: AI speed + human judgment
* **Proposal Language:** "Our teams don't just use AI — they build AI into everything they do. Humans amplified by intelligent automation deliver exceptional results faster."

### 5. Remote-First Advantages
* Distributed team across time zones; asynchronous documentation as default
* 24/7 productivity capability; lower overhead = better rates
* **Proposal Language:** "Our remote-first structure isn't a compromise — it's an advantage. Time zone distribution means round-the-clock productivity."

### 6. Transparent Economics
* One monthly fee per team; all third-party costs identified upfront
* No hidden fees or surprise charges
* **Proposal Language:** "One monthly fee covers your team. Third-party costs (APIs, cloud services) are identified during scoping and approved before we incur them."

### 7. Partnership Over Vendor Relationship
* Collaborative decision-making; shared success metrics
* Long-term thinking; extension of client's team
* **Proposal Language:** "We're not a vendor — we're a partner. Your priorities drive our work, and your success is our success."

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. Traditional Agencies
* **Them:** Fixed scope, high overhead, vendor mentality
* **Us:** Flexible capacity, lean structure, partnership approach

### vs. Full-Time Hires
* **Them:** $200K+ per specialist, benefits, management overhead
* **Us:** Fractional access to multiple specialists, no overhead, immediate productivity

### vs. Offshore Contractors
* **Them:** Communication barriers, quality issues, lack of ownership
* **Us:** Seamless communication, US leadership, complete client ownership

### vs. Other Fractional Services
* **Them:** Limited specialization, no AI integration, generic solutions
* **Us:** Deep expertise, AI-first approach, custom solutions

## ROI Comparison

**Building These Capabilities Internally:**
* Technical writer: $75K-95K/year + benefits
* Recruiter: $60K-80K/year + benefits + tools
* Junior developer: $80K-100K/year + benefits + tools
* **Total: $215K-275K/year for 3 generalists**

**With Purely Works Focused Teams:**
* Access to 6+ specialized FTE across all domains
* No benefits, equipment, or tool costs
* No hiring, training, or management overhead
* Scale up and down based on actual needs
* **Pay only for capacity actively being used**

---

# 5. PACT Methodology

PACT (Problem-Aware Collaborative Targeting) is Purely Works' proprietary sales targeting framework. It guides how we identify, qualify, and engage prospects.

## The Four Pillars

### P — Problem-Aware
* Lead with the prospect's specific pain point, never our features
* Research before outreach: what's keeping this person up at night?
* Map pain points to specific Purely Works services
* Use their language, not ours

### A — Aligned
* Match our capabilities to their actual needs (not what we want to sell)
* Recommend the right entry service — usually Purely Flex ($6K/mo) unless they have a clear high-volume need
* Identify multi-service expansion potential but don't pitch everything at once
* Ensure genuine fit before pursuing (cultural fit matters)

### C — Collaborative
* Position as partner, not vendor
* Use "we" and "our" language
* Propose working together, not "selling to"
* Emphasize shared success metrics
* Frame engagement as "extension of your team"

### T — Trigger-Timed
* Outreach aligned to specific trigger events (funding, hiring, leadership change, lost deal, etc.)
* Fresh triggers get immediate outreach (within 48 hours)
* Stale triggers (60+ days) require re-validation
* Monitor for new triggers on Priority 2 prospects

## Trigger Event Categories

### Funding Events (HIGH PRIORITY)
* Series A/B/C funding announcements
* IPO preparation signals
* Grant awards (biotech, government contracts)
* Private equity investment

### Leadership Changes (HIGH PRIORITY)
* New CTO, VP Engineering, VP BD, CMO hired
* New CEO with mandate to modernize
* New Head of Operations

### Growth Signals (MEDIUM-HIGH)
* Job postings (especially technical roles, proposal writers, recruiters)
* Office expansion or new market entry
* Revenue milestone announcements
* New product launches

### Pain Signals (MEDIUM-HIGH)
* Lost major bid/contract
* Key employee departures
* Negative reviews citing capacity issues
* Competitor winning with AI-enhanced approach

### Industry Events (MEDIUM)
* Regulatory changes affecting operations
* Infrastructure bill project deadlines
* Industry association conference attendance
* Market consolidation/M&A activity

## Engagement Sequence

### First Touch
* Reference specific trigger event
* Acknowledge their situation with empathy
* Connect to Purely Works capability (briefly)
* Offer value without asking for anything
* Suggest conversation, not a pitch

### Follow-Up (Day 7)
* Add new value (article, insight, case study)
* Light touch — "just wanted to share this"
* No pressure

### Final Attempt (Day 14)
* Direct but warm
* "I know timing is everything — happy to reconnect when it makes sense"
* Leave door open

## Service Entry Point Strategy

| ICP | Recommended Entry Service | Typical Starting Retainer |
|-----|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Construction | Proposal Services | $8K-15K/mo |

| SaaS | Fractional Dev Team or AI Feature Project | $12K-20K/mo |
| Entertainment | Marketing/Content Production | $10K-15K/mo |
| Biotech | Grant Proposals or Marketing | $8K-25K/project |

**Default for uncertain fit:** Purely Flex at $6K/month.

## Multi-Service Expansion Playbook

* **Year 1:** Establish core service, prove ROI
* **Year 2:** Add second service based on observed needs
* **Year 3:** Full partnership across 3+ services
* **Never pitch expansion until the first service is delivering clear value.**

* **Revenue:** $30M-$250M
* **Location Focus:** LA County, Orange County, San Diego County
* **Decision Makers:** CEO/President, VP Business Development, VP Operations, Director of Marketing

### Critical Pain Points
1. **Win Rate Improvement** — Industry average 45%; 5-10 point gap = $2-5M additional revenue
2. **RFP Response Efficiency** — 25 hours per proposal, 9 contributors, ~$100K in labor annually
3. **IIJA Funding Opportunity** — $62B+ allocated to California over 10 years
4. **Digital Transformation Gap** — 70% lack documented tech roadmap
5. **Labor Shortage Crisis** — 500K+ worker deficit; 41% of workforce retiring by 2031

### Buying Triggers
* Lost major RFP to competitor
* New business development leader hired
* Pursuing larger public-sector contracts
* Competitor won with AI-generated content
* IIJA or state infrastructure bill deadline approaching

* **Year 2:** Add Development (automation APIs, Procore integrations) ($15-20K/mo)
* **Year 3+:** Full Partnership + Advisory ($25K+/mo)

### Common Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|---------|
| "We've always done proposals in-house" | "Precisely. And you're spending 25+ hours per proposal while competitors are moving faster. We don't replace your team — we amplify them." |
| "This is a relationship-driven industry; AI can't understand our nuances" | "We work with your templates, your past proposals, your client relationships. AI handles the heavy lifting so your team focuses on relationship-building." |
| "Cost doesn't justify savings" | "25 hours × $75/hr = $1,875 per proposal. At 10 proposals/year, you save $18,750 in labor alone. Plus win rate gains." |

### Sales Cycle: 45-90 days
* Warm intro close rate: 30-40%
* Cold outreach close rate: 5-10%

### Target Companies (SoCal)

4. **AI Competition** — 99% of Fortune 500 using AI recruiting

| "We tried AI before; it didn't work" | "Most off-the-shelf tools are generic. We train on your firm's placements, your messaging, your specialization. Success rate jumps dramatically with context." |
| "This is expensive; payback is unclear" | "At $8K/month, you break even on first 4-5 placements. ROI is 300%+ in year one, plus improved team retention." |

### Sales Cycle: 30-60 days (FASTEST of all ICPs)

| "IP ownership; you'll use our code for other clients" | "All code, models, training data stay with you. We sign ironclad confidentiality agreements. This is our standard with funded startups." |
| "Cost is too high; we're managing burn" | "One quarter of engineer distraction costs more than 6 months of our services. Plus you keep engineers focused on core product roadmap." |

▶ **Initial Message**

```
Subject: AI for project controls dashboards?

Hi Mark,

I came across your profile while researching construction project controls firms, and your note about being "passionate about digital and technology solutions for capital projects" really stood out.

I've been helping a few project controls consultancies build AI-powered tools that automate the heavy lifting — things like auto-generating executive dashboards, analyzing contractor schedules for delays, and flagging risks before they become problems.

I was wondering if Mammoth has explored using AI to scale your PMIS and reporting services without adding headcount?

If you're curious, I'd be happy to show you what we've built for similar firms. Even if timing isn't right, I'm always excited to chat with someone who's thinking ahead on construction tech.

All the best,
Farid Kheloco
CEO / Co-Founder

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|---------|
| "We handle this in-house" | "That's great that you have the technical capability. What I've found with similar firms is that it's often the *prioritization* that's the challenge — your team is billing hours on client work, so internal tool development gets deprioritized. We've helped firms like yours treat internal tools as a strategic project with dedicated resources, while your team stays billable. Would that model make sense?" |
| "Too expensive" | "I totally get budget sensitivity, especially for a firm your size. The way we typically structure this is to start with one high-ROI tool — maybe automating executive dashboard generation or schedule risk analysis — and show measurable time savings in 60-90 days. Then you can decide if expanding makes sense." |
| "Not the right time" | "I appreciate the honesty about timing. What I'm seeing across the construction project controls space is that 2025 is becoming 'the year' for digital transformation — firms that move now are positioning as tech leaders, while those who wait risk being seen as traditional. But I completely understand if you're mid-project or have other priorities. Can I check back in Q2/Q3?" |
| "We don't have internal tech resources" | "That's actually exactly why firms come to us. You shouldn't need a CTO or dev team to have modern tools. We build, deploy, and maintain everything — you just use it. Think of us as your fractional AI development team, but only for the specific tools that matter to your business. Everything we create is 100% yours, no licensing fees." |
| "Our clients don't ask for this" | "You're right that clients may not ask for 'AI tools' specifically — but they *do* ask for faster insights, proactive risk identification, and better visibility into their projects. When firms like Mammoth can deliver those outcomes more efficiently, it becomes a competitive advantage. You're not selling 'AI' to clients — you're delivering better results, faster, at the same or lower cost." |

### Multi-Service Expansion Path

**Phase 1 (Entry)**: Development — Build 1-2 AI-powered internal tools ($30K-$60K, 2-3 months)
**Phase 2 (Expand)**: Consulting — Digital transformation strategy roadmap ($15K-$25K, 1-2 months)
**Phase 3 (Scale)**: Marketing — Thought leadership content, speaking opportunities ($10K-$20K, ongoing)
**Phase 4 (Partnership)**: Recruiting — AI-savvy project controls professionals

**Total Year 1 Potential**: $55K-$105K
**Year 2+ (Expansion)**: $75K-$150K/year

### Why This Is Priority 1

🎯 **Perfect Timing**: Construction digital transformation is THE industry trend — momentum is massive
🔥 **Decision-Maker Passion**: Mark's explicit statement about being "passionate about digital and technology solutions" is a golden signal
💼 **Clear Pain Point**: Small firm competing against tech-investing giants (Bechtel, AECOM) — needs differentiation
🤝 **Cultural Fit**: Partnership language throughout, quality focus, women-owned (values-aligned)
⚡ **No Acute Urgency**: Only weakness — no funding, hiring, or crisis trigger. But industry momentum compensates.

# 11. Publishing Workflow

Every report follows this exact workflow:

### Step 1: Create the Markdown File
* Write the report following the exact template structure
* Save as .md file with correct naming convention
* Store locally for backup

### Step 2: Publish to Notion
* Use the Notion MCP tool (`notion-create-pages`) to publish
* Place in the correct Notion location:
  - Conference Analysis → Sales Intelligence > Conference Analysis folder
  - Weekly Intelligence → Sales Intelligence > Weekly Intelligence folder
  - Opportunity Research → Sales Intelligence > Opportunity Research folder
* Set page title to match report title
* Content field = full markdown content
* Do NOT include the page title in the content (it goes in properties)

### Step 3: Update Lead Reports Database (for Opportunity Research only)
* Create a new entry in the Lead Reports database using field mappings above
* Use data source ID: `2ff35079-f52e-806c-909c-000b99f31f52`

### Step 4: Confirm Completion
* Provide the Notion page URL
* Provide the local .md file path
* Summarize key findings (Priority tier, recommended action, estimated value)

### Formatting Standards for Notion
* Use Notion-compatible markdown (headers, bullets, tables, callouts)
* Include toggle blocks for long sections: `▶ Toggle Title` + indented content
* Use callouts for key information: `> 💡 **Note**: Important information`
* All tables must be markdown-formatted
* Use dividers (`---`) between major sections only
* Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
* Asterisk bullets (Farid's preference)
