---

## Brand Voice

**The Consistent Personality Across All Communications**

### Core Characteristics

**1. Authoritative Yet Approachable**
- Speak with confidence backed by 70 years of advisory expertise
- Share knowledge freely without condescension
- Admit what we don't know and explain what we're learning
- Position as peer advisor, not distant expert

**Example (Right):**
"Most advisor partnerships fail due to culture misalignment. Here's what we've learned about predicting compatibility..."

**Example (Wrong):**
"Your partnership will definitely fail unless you use Cathedral Center's proprietary assessment."

---

**2. Advisory, Not Sales-Focused**
- Guide advisors to better decisions, regardless of whether they use Cathedral Center
- Position assessment as consulting engagement, not sales funnel
- Lead with insights, not product features
- Focus on advisor benefit, not SageCrest/Cathedral benefit

**Example (Right):**
"Whether you work with us or not, these are the five dimensions you should evaluate in any partnership."

**Example (Wrong):**
"Our platform is the only way to properly evaluate partnerships. Buy now!"

---

**3. Evidence-Based & Data-Driven**
- Back claims with research, methodology, and data
- Cite industry statistics (70% M&A failure rate, etc.)
- Reference our DNA assessment framework specifically
- Show our work and reasoning

**Example (Right):**
"Research shows ~70% of advisor M&A partnerships fail within 5 years. Most decisions rely on financial metrics alone, missing culture fit assessment. Our five-dimension DNA approach addresses this gap."

**Example (Wrong):**
"Most partnerships fail. We can help."

---

**4. Clear & Accessible**
- Use plain language over industry jargon
- Explain concepts clearly without oversimplifying
- Assume intelligence but not deep knowledge of Cathedral Center
- Define acronyms and terms on first use

**Example (Right):**
"We assess what we call your 'DNA'—the five core dimensions of compatibility: Culture (work environment alignment), Values (business philosophy match), Behavior (team dynamic fit), Needs (what you require from a partner), and Desires (where you want to go)."

**Example (Wrong):**
"Our proprietary five-dimensional DNA scoring algorithm evaluates psychographic and operational compatibility metrics."

---

**5. Conversational Yet Professional**
- Write as you would speak to a peer advisor
- Use contractions (we're, doesn't, etc.)
- Ask rhetorical questions to engage
- Tell stories and use examples
- Maintain professional credibility

**Example (Right):**
"Here's what we've seen: Firms that look only at numbers often miss culture misalignment that derails integration. You probably have a few acquisition candidates you're evaluating—let's talk about what to look for beyond the financial metrics."

**Example (Wrong):**
"This organization has formally identified that cultural misalignment represents a primary risk factor in mergers and acquisitions within the financial advisory sector."

---

**6. Honest & Transparent**
- Acknowledge limitations and unknowns
- Be transparent about what Cathedral Center does and doesn't do
- Admit when something is hard or uncertain
- Show the thinking behind decisions

**Example (Right):**
"The Tier 3 deep dive takes 2-4 hours because culture fit assessment requires depth. There's no shortcut to really understanding if a partnership will work."

**Example (Wrong):**
"Our assessment is quick and easy!"

## Tone

**The Emotional Quality That Varies by Context**

### Tones We Use

#### 1. Consultative (Most Common)
**When:** Giving advice, recommending approaches, sharing insights

**Characteristics:**
- Thoughtful and deliberate
- Expert but not arrogant
- Collaborative ("let's think through this together")
- Patient and thorough

**Example:**
"You're asking a great question about behavioral fit. Here's how we think about it: The DAAN framework identifies four behavioral patterns—Driver, Analytical, Amiable, and Expressive. Your team might be heavy on Drivers (fast, competitive), and you're evaluating a practice that's Analytical (methodical, risk-aware). These can complement each other if managed well, or conflict if not. Let's explore which applies to your situation."

---

#### 2. Encouraging (For Engagement & Calls to Action)
**When:** Inviting advisors to engage, offering resources, supporting action

**Characteristics:**
- Positive and forward-focused
- Empowering (you can do this)
- Supportive (we're here to help)
- Clear and compelling

**Example:**
"Ready to evaluate your growth options with clarity? Take our free assessment and get immediate insights into your firm's DNA. You'll understand what partnerships align with your culture, values, and vision—valuable insights whether you partner with us or not."

---

#### 3. Educational (For Content & Learning)
**When:** Teaching concepts, explaining methodology, sharing knowledge

**Characteristics:**
- Clear and organized
- Accessible without dumbing down
- Well-supported with examples
- Curious and exploratory

**Example:**
"Culture alignment is more than 'are we nice people.' It's about daily work environment, decision-making style, risk tolerance, and growth philosophy. When acquiring firm operates with consensus-based decisions but target firm is directive, integration friction often follows. Here's how to assess this dimension..."

---

#### 4. Empathetic (For Acknowledging Challenges)
**When:** Discussing pain points, acknowledging struggles, showing understanding

**Characteristics:**
- Acknowledges real challenges
- Shows understanding from experience
- Validates concerns
- Forward-focused (this is fixable)

**Example:**
"M&A integration is hard. You've probably seen partnerships that looked great on the financials but fell apart due to team conflict or misaligned expectations. We've seen it too. That's why we focus on culture and fit assessment—because financial metrics alone aren't enough."

---

#### 5. Authoritative (For Positioning & Industry Commentary)
**When:** Establishing expertise, sharing research, positioning Cathedral Center

**Characteristics:**
- Confident and knowledgeable
- Data and research-backed
- Industry-leading perspective
- Thought leadership positioning

**Example:**
"The financial advisory industry has a 70% M&A partnership failure rate. This isn't inevitable. Research shows the most successful partnerships share strong cultural alignment, clear values compatibility, and realistic expectations about integration. We've made it our mission to help advisors assess and achieve this from day one."

---

### Tone Mixing

Most pieces of writing use **multiple tones in combination**:

**Consulting + Encouraging:**
"Here's our perspective on partnership evaluation (consulting), and we're excited to help you get clarity on your options (encouraging)."

**Empathetic + Educational:**
"M&A is complex (empathy), and culture fit assessment is a learnable skill (educational)."

**Authoritative + Consultative:**
"Industry research shows X (authoritative), so let's think about how it applies to your situation (consultative)."

---

## Audience-Specific Tone Adjustments

### Financial Advisors (Primary Audience)

**Tone:** Peer-to-peer, helpful, expert, professional

**Adjust For:**
- Understanding of M&A/recruiting challenges
- Skepticism of "silver bullet" solutions
- Value for time and learning
- Results and ROI focus

**Example (Right):**
"Most firm owners we work with worry about advisor retention during M&A. Here's what we've learned about predicting which advisors will stay vs. leave..."

**Example (Wrong):**
"Our product will solve all your integration challenges."

## Writing Guidelines

### Structure & Organization
- **Lead with insight:** Start with the most important information
- **Use short sentences:** 15-20 words is ideal
- **Break content into chunks:** Use subheadings, bullets, short paragraphs
- **One idea per paragraph:** Don't crowd concepts
- **Conclude with action:** End with clear next step or insight

### Word Choice
- **Avoid jargon:** Use plain English (unless explaining specific industry terms)
- **Be specific:** "We assess five dimensions" not "We provide insights"
- **Use active voice:** "The assessment reveals culture misalignment" not "Culture misalignment is revealed by the assessment"
- **Choose warm words:** "help," "guide," "discover" over "leverage," "maximize," "drive"
- **Use strong verbs:** "accelerate," "transform," "unlock" when earned, not overused

### Prohibited Language

**Avoid:**
- "We're the only..." (rarely true, sounds defensive)
- "Best in class" / "Industry-leading" (tell stories instead of claiming)
- "Synergies" / "Paradigm shifts" (vague business-speak)
- "Advisor" used repeatedly (mix with "you," "practice," "firm")
- ALL CAPS for emphasis (use bold or italics instead)
- Exclamation marks excessively (max 1-2 per 500 words)

**Instead Use:**
- "We've found that..." (supported by evidence)
- "Here's what works..." (specific, actionable)
- "Clearer language" (plain English)
- "Your practice" / "your firm" (personalized)
- Bold for emphasis: **Cathedral Center**
- Strategic punctuation.
