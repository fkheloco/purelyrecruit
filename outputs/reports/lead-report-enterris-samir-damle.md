Subject: Scaling Enterris for the IIJA pipeline?

Hi Samir,

I came across Enterris Associates and I'm genuinely impressed by what you've built since 2021 — growing an MBE infrastructure consulting firm in the SoCal market is no small feat.

With the IIJA pipeline ramping up and your expanding aviation and transportation practice, I was wondering if you've explored AI-powered tools to help scale project management capacity without proportional hiring?

We've been helping infrastructure consulting firms like yours build custom tools that automate dashboards, track compliance across projects, and manage documentation — so your team spends more time on high-value advisory work and less on administrative overhead.

If you're curious, I'd love to show you what we've built for similar firms. Everything we create is 100% client-owned — no licensing, no shared IP.

Happy to work around your schedule.

All the best,
Farid Kheloco
CEO / Co-Founder

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're too busy growing to think about AI right now" | "I totally get that — growth mode means every hour counts. That's actually exactly why firms come to us during growth phases. We handle the entire build so your team stays focused on clients. Think of it as adding capacity without the hiring timeline. What if we started with just one tool — like automated project dashboards — to free up 10-15 hours a week?" |
| "We handle everything in-house" | "That's great that you have strong internal capabilities. What we've found with growing firms is that the bottleneck isn't capability — it's bandwidth. Your team is billing hours on client work, so internal tool development gets deprioritized. We act as a fractional dev team focused specifically on your operational tools, while your experts stay billable." |
| "We don't have the budget for AI tools" | "I appreciate the honesty about budget. The way we typically approach this is to start with one high-ROI automation — something that pays for itself in time savings within 60-90 days. For a firm your size, automating just project reporting can save 15-20 hours per week. We can start at a fraction of what a single FTE would cost." |
| "We're not sure AI is ready for our industry" | "That's a fair concern. What's interesting is that construction and infrastructure consulting is actually one of the fastest-growing sectors for AI adoption right now — precisely because there's so much manual work that can be automated. We're not talking about replacing your expertise — we're building tools that amplify it. Your team's judgment stays central." |
