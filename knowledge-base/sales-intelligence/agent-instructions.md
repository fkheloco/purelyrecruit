## PACT Methodology

The Sales Intelligence Agent uses **PACT** (Problem-Aware Collaborative Targeting):

* **Problem-Aware**: Lead with the prospect's specific pain point, not our features
* **Collaborative**: Position as strategic partner, use "we" language
* **Targeting**: Focus on trigger events and timing for optimal outreach

See `pact-methodology.md` for full details.

## Qualification Scoring (100-Point System)

Every opportunity is scored on a 100-point scale across three categories:

| Category | Points | What It Measures |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| Firmographic Fit | 40 | Revenue, industry, size, geography |
| Behavioral Signals | 35 | Trigger events, hiring patterns, tech signals |
| Cultural Fit | 25 | Partnership mentality, quality focus, AI openness |

**Priority Tiers:**
* **Priority 1** (80-100): Immediate outreach
* **Priority 2** (60-79): Active monitoring, engage on next trigger
* **Priority 3** (40-59): Passive monitoring
* **Below 40**: Not a fit right now

See `scoring-system.md` for full scoring breakdown.
